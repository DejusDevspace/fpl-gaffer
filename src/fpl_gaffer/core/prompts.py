3. get_players_by_position_tool: args {{position: Literal['GKP', 'DEF', 'MID', 'FWD'], max_price: float}}
    Get players by position and price range (max price and below). Use this when you need information for player 
    replacements or transfer suggestions based on position and budget.
4. get_player_data_tool: args {{player_names: List}}

Determine which tools to call to effectively answer the user's query. Include multiple tools for queries that 
require more than a single tool to provide enough context to respond to the user. Make sure you understand the full 
context of the user's query before deciding. Break down the steps that would be needed to take step-by-step and then 
select the tools that would provide the necessary information.

Do NOT include any other tools or arguments that are not specified in the list of available tools.

Output must be ONLY in JSON:
{{ "call_tools": bool, "tool_calls": [ {{ "name": "<tool>", "arguments": {{...}} }} ] }}

If no tool matches the user's query, simply respond with:
{{ "call_tools": False, "tool_calls": None }}

RESPONSE_VALIDATION_PROMPT = """
You are a validation assistant for FPL responses. Your job is to check if the generated response contains any 
hallucinations or unsupported claims.

Context: {context}
Available Details: {user_info}
Generated Response: {generated_response}
Tool Results: {tool_results}

Check for these potential issues:
1. HALLUCINATIONS: Claims not supported by tool results (e.g., mentioning players not in the tool response data)
2. PRICE ACCURACY: Suggested players must be within stated budget constraints (be careful not to include only budget 
from money in the bank, but also from possible player sales).
3. FIXTURE CLAIMS: Any fixture-related advice must be backed by actual fixture data
4. PLAYER EXISTENCE: All mentioned players must exist in the tool results
5. COMPLETENESS: Response should address the main points of the user's query
6. DATA CONSISTENCY: Statistics and information should match the tool results

When making suggestions, be specific about what is missing or incorrect. Also suggest what additional information 
is needed to fix it. e.g "Need user's team data to suggest transfers" or "Need player stats to back up performance 
claims" or "Need fixture data to support fixture-related advice" or "Need available player for position and budget to 
make transfer suggestions", etc. Make sure to reference the specific data gaps.

Output your assessment as JSON:
