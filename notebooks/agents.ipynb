And, inevitably, there were superficial comparisons of Firmino with Ekitike after the win over Yokohama. Variously roaming into deeper positions and running in behind, the Frenchman also produced a flicked effort on goal that most definitely had echoes of ‘Bobby’.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all good: he still looked like he was getting up to speed and appeared a little lost at times. But heck, it’s his first outing of the summer, in ridiculously hot weather, with a new bunch of teammates. Let’s spare any more knee-jerk judgment for now.\\n\\nWIRTZ IMPRESSES\\n\\nSomeone who very much is looking the part already is Florian Wirtz (£8.5m). After leading the line at the weekend, here he was in the ’10’ role that perhaps better suits him. That saw Dominik Szoboszlai (£6.5m) move into a deeper midfield position, the one typically occupied by Alexis Mac Allister (£6.5m), alongside Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m).\\n\\nArne Slot will love Wirtz’s off-the-ball contributions. Purists will love his touch and on-point passing. But FPL managers want end product – and a first Liverpool goal here was welcome in that sense.\\n\\nThe German arrived late in the box, Lampard-like, to sweep home Mohamed Salah‘s (£14.5m) cut-back, which had taken a touch off Curtis Jones (£5.5m) on the way.\\n\\nWirtz was also on corners, albeit with most of his deliveries (from either side) being nodded away. Still, set-piece responsibilities, or at least a share of them, would be welcome.\\n\\nSALAH THE CREATOR\\n\\nHow many times have we heard over the years that Salah is too wide and it’s the death knell for his FPL potential?\\n\\nThe Egyptian has been written off more times than Rocky Balboa but still keeps boinging back, and is fresh from a record-setting 2024/25 campaign. Here he was more creator than goal threat, unfortunate not to get an assist for Wirtz’s goal and deprived of another when Darwin Nunez missed an absolutely sitter.\\n\\nIt’ll still be worth monitoring Slot’s tactics and personnel choices over the coming weeks. It’s noticeable how much Conor Bradley (£5.0m) has been ‘underlapping’ in pre-season, popping up as a right-sided 10 with Salah outside of him. There was more of that in Japan.\\n\\nBut if you throw Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m) into the equation, for instance, Salah’s role changes, as the Dutchman seems more of a width-holder. It was from Frimpong’s inch-perfect cross that Trey Nyoni (£4.5m) prodded in Liverpool’s second.\\n\\nCody Gakpo (£7.5m) was more of a threat on the opposite flank, with Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) less of a space invader: the winger hit the post and saw a one-on-one chance snuffed out.\\n\\nDIAZ DEPARTS, ANOTHER STAR IS BORN?\\n\\nLiverpool are one left-winger down now that Luis Diaz (£8.0m) has departed for Bayern Munich.\\n\\nDo they even need to replace the Colombian in the transfer market, however?\\n\\nRio Ngumoha, who isn’t even listed in FPL, has been the breakout star of the summer. Replacing Gakpo on the left in the second half, the teenager again dazzled with his trickery, going inside and out.\\n\\nAnd a third attacking return of pre-season arrived late on when he collected Andrew Robertson‘s (£6.0m) pass, drove upfield and infield, and fired in Liverpool’s third of the night.\\n\\nAs you would expect, Slot is keen to keep the 16-year-old grounded – but we may have a future FPL star in the making here.\\n\\n“Rio again showed the quality he has and that’s nice for us because we have a lot of very good players.\\n\\n“To get some very good players through the Academy is always helpful and always gives energy to a team as well. It’s always nice to see young players from 16, 17 or 18 years old already impacting a game.\\n\\n“There was also a moment in the game where he should have squared it to Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] or Curtis. So, [there were] also learning parts for him. If you are 16 and you can impact the game like he did, that’s definitely worth a compliment.” – Arne Slot\\n\\nALISSON ABSENCE EXPLAINED\\n\\nThere was no Alisson (£5.5m) here, with Giorgi Mamardashvili (£4.5m) handed the full game.\\n\\nDon’t get too excited about the prospect of a £4.5m starting Liverpool ‘keeper, however: Alisson was only absent for personal reasons.\\n\\n“He had to go back to Brazil for private reasons.\\n\\n“That’s far from ideal – first of all for the private reasons, second of all for him to not be there in a game like this and in pre-season it’s also not ideal if you miss out on part of the pre-season.\\n\\n“But again, private life is more important in these matters than joining a game today.” – Arne Slot on Alisson\\n\\nDefensively, Liverpool again didn’t convince – they particularly looked susceptible to breaks. It’s an exciting squad that Slot is assembling for 2025/26 but the creases still need ironing out at the back.\\n\\nLiverpool XI: Mamardashvili, Bradley (Frimpong 64), van Dijk (Endo 59), Konate (Tsimikas 64), Kerkez (Robertson 64), Gravenberch (Jones 46), Szoboszlai (Elliott 64), Wirtz (Mac Allister 64), Salah (Nyoni 64), Ekitike (Nunez 46), Gakpo (Ngumoha 64).\\n\\nTEAM K LEAGUE 1-0 NEWCASTLE UNITED\\n\\nAnother soul-deflating defeat for the Magpies amid dispiriting off-the-field events but, as is the case elsewhere in pre-season, context is key.\\n\\nOnly four of the 10 starting outfielders sent out in the searing heat of Suwon are what you would call likely 2025/26 starters: Tino Livramento (£5.0m), Sandro Tonali (£5.5m), Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) and new boy Anthony Elanga (£7.0m).\\n\\nEven the substitutes brought on in South Korea were all rookies.\\n\\nSo, no surprise that, with the temperature in the mid-30s and the team understrength, Newcastle were anaemic.\\n\\nOSULA NOT THE ANSWER\\n\\nElanga was arguably the brightest spark, seeing a first-half effort tipped over and teeing up Will Osula (£5.5m) for a couple of chances after the interval. Fellow summer signing Seung-soo Park, a teenager expected to hook up with the B team in 2025/26, was also lively in a late cameo.\\n\\nBut all this friendly did was ram home how much the Magpies need a striker. Callum Wilson is gone, and Alexander Isak (£10.5m) is presumably following suit. Osula, based on the evidence of this summer, is a long way from being the answer.\\n\\nA frustrating, chance-wasting evening in Korea was capped off by his 80th-minute withdrawal, with Gordon going up front for the remainder. If we had to guess how Eddie Howe would line up in Gameweek 1 with no Isak or any replacement aboard, it’d probably be with Gordon through the middle.\\n\\nReports in the media on Wednesday claimed that Isak is currently working on his fitness at his former club, Real Sociedad.\\n\\nBOTMAN INJURY UPDATE\\n\\nAt the back, Nick Pope (£5.0m) was solid amid talk that Aaron Ramsdale is coming aboard. He could do little about Team K League’s winner.\\n\\nSven Botman (£5.0m) missed this match with a relatively minor issue, while Joe Willock (£5.0m) came off late on with what looked like a more serious ankle injury.\\n\\nThe good news, however, is that Lewis Hall (£5.5m) is fit (sort of) again: he was an unused substitute here.\\n\\nNewcastle United XI: Pope (M.Thompson 72), Livramento, A.

It would be typical Arteta to bring Gyokeres slowly and give him his 1st starting spot after the international break. Saka is a no go because I already have 3 heavy priced mids. Last 6 seasons averaged almost 4 goals in this fixture, so yes you\\'re right especially if one team looks to have the better edge, definitely captain material.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\ncravencottage\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n14 Years\\n\\n5 days, 3 hours ago\\n\\nFirst one this year.

Van de Ven looks like Spurs’ best defender. Havertz, as usual, invisible and useless. Kudus has shown nothing in pre-season - Tel might even start GW1.

Meaningless (as is the PFA award, as evidenced when De Bruyne won it last). He\\'s obviously a good player, but Arteta\\'s system is crippling his output - he\\'s stuck in this Bruno-like role where he\\'s being forced to do both the build-up and the final ball because none of his teammates can do it.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nNightcrawler\\n\\n6 Years\\n\\n5 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nI agree with everything, and I\\'ve never considered him a decent FPL pick.

The summer transfer window will have just closed, too.\\n\\nGameweek 7 is also attractive, as Fantasy managers can look to capitalise on Arsenal’s favourable fixture swing.\\n\\nIf this applies to you, there is no need to look too far ahead with the fixtures.\\n\\nBelow is our Season Ticker for the eight clubs featured in the above table, sorted by fixture difficulty in Gameweeks 1-6:\\n\\nBrentford’s Caoimhin Kelleher instantly jumps out. He’s currently the most-owned goalkeeper in FPL, sitting in 32.0% of embryonic squads.\\n\\nThe Bees had to wait until Gameweek 12 of the 2024/25 season to achieve their first clean sheet; however, from that point onwards, they managed to secure eight shut-outs in 27 matches.\\n\\nPrevious Brentford shot-stopper Mark Flekken had plenty of other routes to points. He racked up 156 saves in total, 30 more than the next-best goalkeeper.\\n\\nThat said, this was linked to Thomas Frank’s approach, which limited opponents to low-quality shooting opportunities, frequently from afar. He has since left, along with Christian Norgaard (£5.5m) and Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m), so there are lots of uncertainties regarding Brentford right now.\\n\\nBrentford’s first six home fixtures are incredibly tough, too (AVL/CHE/MUN/MCI/LIV/NEW), but the £4.5 goalkeeper bracket doesn’t appear to be particularly strong this season, so Kelleher still looks like one of the best options on paper.\\n\\nWest Ham United’s Alphonse Areola is a viable alternative. The Hammers managed only three clean sheets in 18 matches under Graham Potter last season, but their fixtures in Gameweeks 1-6 – including Sunderland (a), Crystal Palace (h) and Everton (a) – are rated as the fourth-best from a defensive perspective on our Season Ticker.\\n\\nFor those looking longer-term, Djordje Petrovic, Jose Sa and Bart Verbruggen carry more appeal.\\n\\nThe loss of Kepa Arrizabalaga (£4.5m), Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) will have many Fantasy managers concerned about Bournemouth’s clean sheet potential, but Petrovic excelled on loan at RC Strasbourg last season, where he kept 10 clean sheets in 31 league appearances en route to winning the club’s player of the season award.\\n\\nThe initial Bournemouth fixtures present challenges, but there are at least a couple of matches that offer shut-out potential before the end of September, namely Wolverhampton Wanderers (h) and Leeds United (a).\\n\\nAfter a tough start, Sa and Wolves face all three newly-promoted clubs in Gameweeks 5-9.\\n\\nGameweeks 10-17 is probably the best period for Verbruggen and Brighton. The Dutch goalkeeper has yet to feature in pre-season but was pictured at the Spain training camp.\\n\\nAs for the newly-promoted options, Leeds United’s Lucas Perri is arguably the best bet, particularly given the current uncertainty surrounding Burnley and Sunderland’s starting goalkeepers.\\n\\nDaniel Farke’s side impressed defensively last season, with a total of 25 clean sheets.\\n\\nThe Premier League is a completely different proposition, mind, and there are cheaper £4.0m routes into the Whites’ defence.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL promoted teams: Six-goal Bogle the stand-out Leeds defender\\n\\nAssessing the £4.0m goalkeepers\\n\\nThere are a whopping 39 goalkeepers listed at £4.0m, as detailed above.\\n\\nHowever, it’s unlikely any of them will be a Gameweek 1 starter without an injury or two to a team-mate.\\n\\nThe situation at Tottenham is worth monitoring in pre-season. Guglielmo Vicario (£5.0m) will likely continue as the club’s number one, but Antonin Kinsky’s ability on the ball could make him a decent fit for Frank’s approach. Some have even suggested Kinsky might get the nod in goal, though recent reports have linked him with a loan move to Lille.\\n\\nKarl Darlow’s (£4.0m) stock has fallen following the arrival of Perri, but he could still provide backup with Illan Meslier (£4.5m) potentially on his way out of the club.\\n\\nThe back-up custodians of Crystal Palace (Walter Benitez), Fulham (Benjamin Lecomte) and Nottingham Forest (Carlos Miguel) are all listed at £4.0m.\\n\\nSam Johnstone is expected to leave Wolves, so Dan Bentley could potentially be added too.\\n\\nFor FPL managers looking to spend as little as possible on goalkeepers, these are the only £4.5m/£4.0m first-choice/reserve combinations at the time of writing:\\n\\nWe’ve omitted Burnley and Sunderland from the above list, as the arrival of new goalkeepers will likely push the £4.0m options down into third in the pecking order.\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n282 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFF Scout\\n\\n15 Years\\n\\n6 days, 2 hours ago\\n\\nSpurs vs Arsenal tomorrow, might be interesting for Kinský.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nthe FPL Derby\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n2 Years\\n\\n6 days, 2 hours ago\\n\\nThere\\'s a Derby at Epsom, a Kentucky Derby, a Greyhound Derby.. and now there\\'s the long-awaited \"FPL Derby.\" Over 500 entries so far!!

It\\'s easy to say in one sentence that none of them look like starting, but so much detail and research is required to determine which one out of 39 has the best chance of getting game time. All it takes is for a first choice keeper to lose a bit of form and then you have a starting £4m keeper. If you put the work in, you can get ahead of the curve and already have this keeper in your team because you know which starting keeper is most susceptible to being dropped.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nFPL Virgin\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n5 days, 19 hours ago\\n\\nPicking a £4.0m keeper\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nHairy Potter\\n\\n10 Years\\n\\n5 days, 18 hours ago\\n\\nBut you\\'re just going to blame some random content creator or Neale\\'s predicted lineups when you have a poor season.

Anyhow, Havertz actually started well and I was reminded of Antonio (with Behnrama 21-22 start). Two things then happened.

What price structure you go with also has a lot to do with the flexibility of squad as well. Let us break this down with the example of my current premiums.\\n\\nIn my current draft (which is far away from my final one), I have Mohamed Salah (£14.5m), Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) in my team.\\n\\nLet me explain the reasoning behind the same, starting with captaincy.\\n\\nSalah is an opening-day monster who is a good option to cover Gameweeks 1, 4 and 5. His fixtures in Gameweeks 2 and 3 are not the best on paper, which is why it might be helpful to find captaincy options in those Gameweeks.\\n\\nPalmer does a good job of covering Gameweeks 2 and 3. He’s got a decent run of fixtures at the start of the season, which really turns great from Gameweek 9 onwards.\\n\\nWhat stands out in Gameweek 2, though, is that Arsenal face Leeds United at home. If I can help it, I want to have a captaincy option from the Gunners in that week, which is why I’m thinking of including either Gyokeres or Bukayo Saka (£10.0m). Now, Palmer against West Ham United (away) or Salah against Newcastle United (away) are perfectly good captaincy options. That fixture against Leeds just stands out. however.\\n\\nHAALAND’S CASE FOR INCLUSION\\n\\nAlternatively, if you look at Erling Haaland’s (£14.0m) fixtures, he’s a good captaincy option in most weeks except Gameweek 5. There’s certainly a case to make to start the season with him, should you choose to do it.\\n\\nThe real appealing match-up for Haaland, though, is the fixture in Gameweek 6 at home to Burnley. He is definitely the best captaincy option that week. From that point, he’s got a good run of fixtures and it would be very handy to have him from Gameweeks 6 to 10.\\n\\nThis is where the flexibility and team structure come in. By virtue of owning two of the most expensive midfielders in Salah and Palmer, your team automatically becomes a little more flexible. Simply put, if you’re cash isn’t distributed and is instead condensed amongst some of the premiums, it should take fewer moves to get to another heavy hitter. To make it even simpler: it is easier to sell Salah than to buy him.\\n\\nThat is why a punt on Gyokeres (it is very much a punt at this stage) is an idea I am considering right now, so that I have money constricted in my squad in three places. This makes it easier to distribute and buy a certain Norwegian in Gameweek 6 if I choose to go there.\\n\\nGyokeres can very much be Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), too, given his fixtures at the start of the season. We can’t confidently say that Gyokeres is nailed on to start the first two games (as of now), given the presence of Kai Havertz (£7.5m) and the fact that Gyokeres has joined training late. We don’t even know how quickly he’ll bed in with his new teammates.\\n\\nINFORMATION OVERLOAD\\n\\nSpeaking of knowing things, I feel like there is so much information to obtain at the start of the season that it is important to be agile while picking your squad. Think about it: we’ve had more turnover at the top clubs than in any other season in recent memory.\\n\\nLiverpool alone could have two or three new players in their front four and two new players in their back five. We don’t have reliable information yet on who the picks at Manchester City might be outside of Haaland, given the number of options there. We don’t know who is going to be on penalties between Saka or Gyokeres. Spurs have a new manager.\\n\\nThere is simply a lot to learn, especially with little to no pre-season for Manchester City and Chelsea. We don’t quite realise how much information is going to hit us in the first few weeks, which is why being flexible and not being handcuffed is important.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by handcuffs? I refer to the Bench Boost. If I can help it, I really want to utilise my Bench Boost before I use my first Wildcard. If you haven’t already seen Pras’ chip strategy video, I highly recommend it:\\n\\nWHEN TO WILDCARD?\\n\\nGiven the barrage of information that we might receive in the first few weeks, my approach to a Wildcard is to be agile between Gameweeks 6 and 13. Let’s have a quick look at the landscape:\\n\\nArsenal have a great run from Gameweek 7 onwards and Chelsea from Gameweek 9 onwards. While Liverpool and Manchester City have very appealing schedules from Gameweek 13, their matches from Gameweeks 8/6 respectively are not bad at all.\\n\\nGiven the number of expensive assets from these teams that we’ll need together, team value might be very important this season. In addition, to afford more of these players in your team, you will need to make sure you don’t spread your funds and spend them on the pitch.\\n\\nWhile the teams to target on a Gameweek 13 Wildcard will be City and Liverpool, going early on these assets, given their fixtures, won’t be a bad idea.\\n\\nThat is why I have an agile approach to a Wildcard between Gameweeks 6 and 13 based on how confident I am with what I’ve learned in the first few Gameweeks and provided I’ve used my Bench Boost.\\n\\nBENCH BOOST BEFORE WILDCARD\\n\\nIf I’ve used my Bench Boost before my Wildcard (which is what I really want to do), I will be able to go bottom price on my second ‘keeper, fifth defender and eighth attacker, which means I am not spreading my funds and spending them on the pitch instead. That will allow me to get a higher chunk of expensive assets from good teams. I can always spread funds around during AFCON once Salah leaves to help deal with the Christmas rotation.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I am looking at an early Bench Boost. Which week for that chip is something I will explore in a later article.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this one!\\n\\nPosted by lateriser12 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n325 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFodderx4\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nMorning All, how is this looking for now? 442 is currently appealing to me before as can see the premium defenders outscoring midfielders and forwards upto 6m.

I have always placed huge emphasis on getting things pretty right for GW 1 but this year is particularly challenging. The uncertainty (player movement, new to PL, new coaches, players with huge reputations, traps), there is a need to be cautious. I have read a lot of thoughts about BB in GW1 and feel that this may be premature. I will attempt to bank a few transfers and launch BB around weeks 4 or 5. That will then give me some time to reset for a wildcard around 10-13.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAaa\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nWhat to change here?

Waiting lets you see if there\\'s any good cheapies available. Not just that but increases the likelihood of an early wildcard, as when you see that extra cash on the bench you\\'ll want to put it on the pitch\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nEarly wildcard of course might be the play though if Isak ends up at Liverpool GW4, etc\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Mal\\n\\n1 Year\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nThere\\'s two sides to that. If you don\\'t play it early, then it could disrupt your planning, at some point you might have to spend a transfer on your 2nd keeper/5th defender/8th attacker instead of focusing on higher upside moves. The main negatives of an early BB are definitely the lack of info and the lower team value. However, starting without Salah and Haaland seems more viable than other years making it easier to spread the funds, but we\\'ll most likely need at least one of them further down the line. Another factor to consider is that saving it for later means you\\'ll play it when teams have a tighter schedule (cups and European competitions) increasing the rotation risk.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nI will probably try to use it straight after wildcarding and use barely any funds to play it.

They provide valuable cover for injuries or unexpected absences, and free up funds to invest in your starting XI.\\n\\nChoosing reliable budget picks also helps protect your team’s value, as players who get regular game time are less likely to drop in price.\\n\\nAnd sometimes, these cheap options exceed all expectations. We’re all still chasing the dream of uncovering the next John Lundstram — the £4.0m ‘defender’ who shocked FPL managers in the 2019-20 season with 144 points, scoring five goals and registering four assists for Sheffield United.\\n\\nHere, we will go through this season’s best enablers.\\n\\nGoalkeepers\\n\\nAntonin Kinsky (£4.0m) looks like the only potential starting goalkeeper in his price bracket. There is no guarantee that Tottenham Hotspur’s new head coach, Thomas Frank, will retain Guglielmo Vicario (£5.0m) as the No 1.\\n\\nKarl Darlow (£4.0m) ousted Illan Meslier (£4.5m) at the tail end of last season as the first-choice ‘keeper for Leeds United. Darlow started the last seven games in Leeds’ Championship-winning campaign, keeping four clean sheets. The signing of Lucas Perri (£4.5m) from Lyon, however, probably ends Darlow’s hopes of starting the season as first choice, but keep an eye on proceedings.\\n\\nDefenders\\n\\nMaxime Esteve (£4.0m) from promoted Burnley looks nailed on to play regularly, especially since he just signed a contract extension to 2030. The centre-back started every league game last season as Burnley kept a record 30 clean sheets.\\n\\nMeanwhile, centre-back Joe Rodon (£4.0m) from promotion rivals Leeds also started 46 games last campaign, so should see plenty of game time.\\n\\nBurnley and Leeds are unlikely to register many clean sheets but Rodon and Esteve will probably pick up a fair few points from the new defensive contributions rule. Defenders can now gain an extra two points if they manage 10 ‘defensive contributions’, which include clearances, blocks, interceptions and tackles (CBIT).\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe Rodon is likely to play regularly for Leeds (Linnea Rheborg/Getty Images)\\n\\nA more exciting option is new Leeds signing Gabriel Gudmundsson (£4.0m). The left-back should provide an attacking threat in open play and he has been taking corners in pre-season.\\n\\nAt Sunderland, Trai Hume (£4.0m) should also be nailed on to start. However, Regis Le Bris’ team seem to be the weakest of the promoted sides, making him less appealing when the alternatives seem much better.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe budget defender with the biggest upside is Ayden Heaven (£4.0m) of Manchester United. The 18-year-old showed signs he could establish himself last season before suffering an ankle injury in March.\\n\\nHe has played in pre-season, so keep an eye on him for Manchester United’s remaining games.\\n\\nMidfielders\\n\\nThe £4.5m midfielders look a bit scarce this season. If you intend to start with one, then you should be on a 3-4-3 or 4-4-2 formation and have that ‘enabler’ as a first or second bench option.\\n\\nJustin Devenny (Crystal Palace), Lewis Miley (Newcastle United), Romain Faivre (Bournemouth) and Aaron Ramsey (Burnley) look like the best bets for £4.5m midfielders.\\n\\nOf course, we may have some more emerge before the Gameweek 1 deadline.\\n\\nMiley has impressed for Newcastle when called upon and the 19-year-old looks a real talent. With Sean Longstaff (£5.0m) joining Leeds and Joe Willock (5.0m) being linked to a move away and currently injured, Miley may well have his breakthrough season.\\n\\nBurnley’s Ramsey has some upside as a winger. He racked up eight goals and four assists for Norwich and Middlesbrough in the 2022-23 season, which led to a permanent move to Turf Moor.\\n\\nHe suffered a serious knee injury in February 2024, keeping him out for over a year, but he does seem to be fit now.\\n\\n\\n\\nAaron Ramsey is fit again after a serious knee injury (Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\\n\\nFaivre, meanwhile, spent last season on loan at Brest, where he registered three goals and two assists in 20 games. He is versatile and can play anywhere across the midfield.\\n\\nThese are all decent options but we’re still waiting for a nailed-on starting £4.5m midfielder to emerge.\\n\\nKeep a close eye on transfer developments but it might be worth going up to the £5.0m bracket, where we have a few decent options.\\n\\nCarlos Baleba (£5.0m) will start for Brighton and would have scored an scored an extra 30 points for defensive contributions last campaign. He also has the potential to deliver occasional attacking returns, having contributed three goals and an assist in the Premier League last season.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBournemouth’s Ryan Christie (£5.0m) could also be a good option if he is fit to start the season. He averaged over 12 defensive contributions per game in 2024-25 and showed some attacking threat, too, registering two goals and three assists.\\n\\nEnzo Le Fee (£5.0m) looks like the most enticing, though.\\n\\nYes, he plays for Sunderland, but the Frenchman will start, takes free kicks and corners, and has fantastic fixtures to start the season. Sunderland play West Ham United (H), Burnley (A), Brentford (H), Crystal Palace (A) and Aston Villa (H) in their first five league matches.\\n\\nForwards\\n\\nWe are also short of £4.5m forwards, unfortunately. There are more than 20 forwards in this price category but no solid prospects.\\n\\nMarc Guiu (£4.5m)’s potential loan move to Sunderland has given us a bit of hope for a starting £4.5m forward. He will have Eliezer Mayenda (£5.5m) and Wilson Isidor (£5.5m) as competition, but he could well oust them as his new team’s number one centre-forward.\\n\\nThe 19-year-old does at least have some Premier League experience and I imagine that head coach Regis Le Bris will give him a chance to stake his worth.\\n\\nIf he manages to nail down a starting spot, he could be a gamebreaker and the best enabler in the game.\\n\\nElsewhere, Burnley’s Ashley Barnes (£4.5m) has plenty of Premier League experience but, at the age of 35, he probably will not play enough minutes.\\n\\nFinally, Sunderland’s Ahmed Abdullahi (£4.5m) has scored in pre-season and the manager has encouraging words for him, too, with Le Bris telling the Sunderland Echo last month: “Now he is ready to start and it means he can have a full pre-season.”\\n\\nHe missed almost the entire last campaign through injury but if he continues to impress, he could work his way into the starting line-up.\\n\\nWhen looking at basement budget options, the most important thing is minutes.\\n\\nWe don’t pick these guys to play in our starting XI but to provide adequate bench cover for unexpected injuries or our starting players being benched. We also need them to play minutes so they don’t drop in value.\\n\\nIf there are no real options in that bracket that fit the above criteria, then it’s best to go up a price point.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe have a fair few £4.0m defenders who look like they are going to get game time.\\n\\nThe game’s available budget midfielders and forwards are weak gambles but I am confident one or two solid bets will emerge before the start of the season.\\n\\n(Top photos: Carlos Baleba, left, and Ayden Heaven; Getty Images)\\n\\nConnections: Sports Edition\\n\\nConnections: Sports Edition\\n\\nJan 1, 2025\\n\\nConnections: Sports Edition\\n\\nSpot the pattern.

What price structure you go with also has a lot to do with the flexibility of squad as well. Let us break this down with the example of my current premiums.\\n\\nIn my current draft (which is far away from my final one), I have Mohamed Salah (£14.5m), Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) in my team.\\n\\nLet me explain the reasoning behind the same, starting with captaincy.\\n\\nSalah is an opening-day monster who is a good option to cover Gameweeks 1, 4 and 5. His fixtures in Gameweeks 2 and 3 are not the best on paper, which is why it might be helpful to find captaincy options in those Gameweeks.\\n\\nPalmer does a good job of covering Gameweeks 2 and 3. He’s got a decent run of fixtures at the start of the season, which really turns great from Gameweek 9 onwards.\\n\\nWhat stands out in Gameweek 2, though, is that Arsenal face Leeds United at home. If I can help it, I want to have a captaincy option from the Gunners in that week, which is why I’m thinking of including either Gyokeres or Bukayo Saka (£10.0m). Now, Palmer against West Ham United (away) or Salah against Newcastle United (away) are perfectly good captaincy options. That fixture against Leeds just stands out. however.\\n\\nHAALAND’S CASE FOR INCLUSION\\n\\nAlternatively, if you look at Erling Haaland’s (£14.0m) fixtures, he’s a good captaincy option in most weeks except Gameweek 5. There’s certainly a case to make to start the season with him, should you choose to do it.\\n\\nThe real appealing match-up for Haaland, though, is the fixture in Gameweek 6 at home to Burnley. He is definitely the best captaincy option that week. From that point, he’s got a good run of fixtures and it would be very handy to have him from Gameweeks 6 to 10.\\n\\nThis is where the flexibility and team structure come in. By virtue of owning two of the most expensive midfielders in Salah and Palmer, your team automatically becomes a little more flexible. Simply put, if you’re cash isn’t distributed and is instead condensed amongst some of the premiums, it should take fewer moves to get to another heavy hitter. To make it even simpler: it is easier to sell Salah than to buy him.\\n\\nThat is why a punt on Gyokeres (it is very much a punt at this stage) is an idea I am considering right now, so that I have money constricted in my squad in three places. This makes it easier to distribute and buy a certain Norwegian in Gameweek 6 if I choose to go there.\\n\\nGyokeres can very much be Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), too, given his fixtures at the start of the season. We can’t confidently say that Gyokeres is nailed on to start the first two games (as of now), given the presence of Kai Havertz (£7.5m) and the fact that Gyokeres has joined training late. We don’t even know how quickly he’ll bed in with his new teammates.\\n\\nINFORMATION OVERLOAD\\n\\nSpeaking of knowing things, I feel like there is so much information to obtain at the start of the season that it is important to be agile while picking your squad. Think about it: we’ve had more turnover at the top clubs than in any other season in recent memory.\\n\\nLiverpool alone could have two or three new players in their front four and two new players in their back five. We don’t have reliable information yet on who the picks at Manchester City might be outside of Haaland, given the number of options there. We don’t know who is going to be on penalties between Saka or Gyokeres. Spurs have a new manager.\\n\\nThere is simply a lot to learn, especially with little to no pre-season for Manchester City and Chelsea. We don’t quite realise how much information is going to hit us in the first few weeks, which is why being flexible and not being handcuffed is important.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by handcuffs? I refer to the Bench Boost. If I can help it, I really want to utilise my Bench Boost before I use my first Wildcard. If you haven’t already seen Pras’ chip strategy video, I highly recommend it:\\n\\nWHEN TO WILDCARD?\\n\\nGiven the barrage of information that we might receive in the first few weeks, my approach to a Wildcard is to be agile between Gameweeks 6 and 13. Let’s have a quick look at the landscape:\\n\\nArsenal have a great run from Gameweek 7 onwards and Chelsea from Gameweek 9 onwards. While Liverpool and Manchester City have very appealing schedules from Gameweek 13, their matches from Gameweeks 8/6 respectively are not bad at all.\\n\\nGiven the number of expensive assets from these teams that we’ll need together, team value might be very important this season. In addition, to afford more of these players in your team, you will need to make sure you don’t spread your funds and spend them on the pitch.\\n\\nWhile the teams to target on a Gameweek 13 Wildcard will be City and Liverpool, going early on these assets, given their fixtures, won’t be a bad idea.\\n\\nThat is why I have an agile approach to a Wildcard between Gameweeks 6 and 13 based on how confident I am with what I’ve learned in the first few Gameweeks and provided I’ve used my Bench Boost.\\n\\nBENCH BOOST BEFORE WILDCARD\\n\\nIf I’ve used my Bench Boost before my Wildcard (which is what I really want to do), I will be able to go bottom price on my second ‘keeper, fifth defender and eighth attacker, which means I am not spreading my funds and spending them on the pitch instead. That will allow me to get a higher chunk of expensive assets from good teams. I can always spread funds around during AFCON once Salah leaves to help deal with the Christmas rotation.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I am looking at an early Bench Boost. Which week for that chip is something I will explore in a later article.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this one!\\n\\nPosted by lateriser12 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n325 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFodderx4\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nMorning All, how is this looking for now? 442 is currently appealing to me before as can see the premium defenders outscoring midfielders and forwards upto 6m.

I have always placed huge emphasis on getting things pretty right for GW 1 but this year is particularly challenging. The uncertainty (player movement, new to PL, new coaches, players with huge reputations, traps), there is a need to be cautious. I have read a lot of thoughts about BB in GW1 and feel that this may be premature. I will attempt to bank a few transfers and launch BB around weeks 4 or 5. That will then give me some time to reset for a wildcard around 10-13.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAaa\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nWhat to change here?

Waiting lets you see if there\\'s any good cheapies available. Not just that but increases the likelihood of an early wildcard, as when you see that extra cash on the bench you\\'ll want to put it on the pitch\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nEarly wildcard of course might be the play though if Isak ends up at Liverpool GW4, etc\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Mal\\n\\n1 Year\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nThere\\'s two sides to that. If you don\\'t play it early, then it could disrupt your planning, at some point you might have to spend a transfer on your 2nd keeper/5th defender/8th attacker instead of focusing on higher upside moves. The main negatives of an early BB are definitely the lack of info and the lower team value. However, starting without Salah and Haaland seems more viable than other years making it easier to spread the funds, but we\\'ll most likely need at least one of them further down the line. Another factor to consider is that saving it for later means you\\'ll play it when teams have a tighter schedule (cups and European competitions) increasing the rotation risk.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nI will probably try to use it straight after wildcarding and use barely any funds to play it.

What price structure you go with also has a lot to do with the flexibility of squad as well. Let us break this down with the example of my current premiums.\\n\\nIn my current draft (which is far away from my final one), I have Mohamed Salah (£14.5m), Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) in my team.\\n\\nLet me explain the reasoning behind the same, starting with captaincy.\\n\\nSalah is an opening-day monster who is a good option to cover Gameweeks 1, 4 and 5. His fixtures in Gameweeks 2 and 3 are not the best on paper, which is why it might be helpful to find captaincy options in those Gameweeks.\\n\\nPalmer does a good job of covering Gameweeks 2 and 3. He’s got a decent run of fixtures at the start of the season, which really turns great from Gameweek 9 onwards.\\n\\nWhat stands out in Gameweek 2, though, is that Arsenal face Leeds United at home. If I can help it, I want to have a captaincy option from the Gunners in that week, which is why I’m thinking of including either Gyokeres or Bukayo Saka (£10.0m). Now, Palmer against West Ham United (away) or Salah against Newcastle United (away) are perfectly good captaincy options. That fixture against Leeds just stands out. however.\\n\\nHAALAND’S CASE FOR INCLUSION\\n\\nAlternatively, if you look at Erling Haaland’s (£14.0m) fixtures, he’s a good captaincy option in most weeks except Gameweek 5. There’s certainly a case to make to start the season with him, should you choose to do it.\\n\\nThe real appealing match-up for Haaland, though, is the fixture in Gameweek 6 at home to Burnley. He is definitely the best captaincy option that week. From that point, he’s got a good run of fixtures and it would be very handy to have him from Gameweeks 6 to 10.\\n\\nThis is where the flexibility and team structure come in. By virtue of owning two of the most expensive midfielders in Salah and Palmer, your team automatically becomes a little more flexible. Simply put, if you’re cash isn’t distributed and is instead condensed amongst some of the premiums, it should take fewer moves to get to another heavy hitter. To make it even simpler: it is easier to sell Salah than to buy him.\\n\\nThat is why a punt on Gyokeres (it is very much a punt at this stage) is an idea I am considering right now, so that I have money constricted in my squad in three places. This makes it easier to distribute and buy a certain Norwegian in Gameweek 6 if I choose to go there.\\n\\nGyokeres can very much be Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), too, given his fixtures at the start of the season. We can’t confidently say that Gyokeres is nailed on to start the first two games (as of now), given the presence of Kai Havertz (£7.5m) and the fact that Gyokeres has joined training late. We don’t even know how quickly he’ll bed in with his new teammates.\\n\\nINFORMATION OVERLOAD\\n\\nSpeaking of knowing things, I feel like there is so much information to obtain at the start of the season that it is important to be agile while picking your squad. Think about it: we’ve had more turnover at the top clubs than in any other season in recent memory.\\n\\nLiverpool alone could have two or three new players in their front four and two new players in their back five. We don’t have reliable information yet on who the picks at Manchester City might be outside of Haaland, given the number of options there. We don’t know who is going to be on penalties between Saka or Gyokeres. Spurs have a new manager.\\n\\nThere is simply a lot to learn, especially with little to no pre-season for Manchester City and Chelsea. We don’t quite realise how much information is going to hit us in the first few weeks, which is why being flexible and not being handcuffed is important.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by handcuffs? I refer to the Bench Boost. If I can help it, I really want to utilise my Bench Boost before I use my first Wildcard. If you haven’t already seen Pras’ chip strategy video, I highly recommend it:\\n\\nWHEN TO WILDCARD?\\n\\nGiven the barrage of information that we might receive in the first few weeks, my approach to a Wildcard is to be agile between Gameweeks 6 and 13. Let’s have a quick look at the landscape:\\n\\nArsenal have a great run from Gameweek 7 onwards and Chelsea from Gameweek 9 onwards. While Liverpool and Manchester City have very appealing schedules from Gameweek 13, their matches from Gameweeks 8/6 respectively are not bad at all.\\n\\nGiven the number of expensive assets from these teams that we’ll need together, team value might be very important this season. In addition, to afford more of these players in your team, you will need to make sure you don’t spread your funds and spend them on the pitch.\\n\\nWhile the teams to target on a Gameweek 13 Wildcard will be City and Liverpool, going early on these assets, given their fixtures, won’t be a bad idea.\\n\\nThat is why I have an agile approach to a Wildcard between Gameweeks 6 and 13 based on how confident I am with what I’ve learned in the first few Gameweeks and provided I’ve used my Bench Boost.\\n\\nBENCH BOOST BEFORE WILDCARD\\n\\nIf I’ve used my Bench Boost before my Wildcard (which is what I really want to do), I will be able to go bottom price on my second ‘keeper, fifth defender and eighth attacker, which means I am not spreading my funds and spending them on the pitch instead. That will allow me to get a higher chunk of expensive assets from good teams. I can always spread funds around during AFCON once Salah leaves to help deal with the Christmas rotation.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I am looking at an early Bench Boost. Which week for that chip is something I will explore in a later article.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this one!\\n\\nPosted by lateriser12 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n325 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFodderx4\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nMorning All, how is this looking for now? 442 is currently appealing to me before as can see the premium defenders outscoring midfielders and forwards upto 6m.

I have always placed huge emphasis on getting things pretty right for GW 1 but this year is particularly challenging. The uncertainty (player movement, new to PL, new coaches, players with huge reputations, traps), there is a need to be cautious. I have read a lot of thoughts about BB in GW1 and feel that this may be premature. I will attempt to bank a few transfers and launch BB around weeks 4 or 5. That will then give me some time to reset for a wildcard around 10-13.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAaa\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nWhat to change here?

If you don\\'t play it early, then it could disrupt your planning, at some point you might have to spend a transfer on your 2nd keeper/5th defender/8th attacker instead of focusing on higher upside moves. The main negatives of an early BB are definitely the lack of info and the lower team value. However, starting without Salah and Haaland seems more viable than other years making it easier to spread the funds, but we\\'ll most likely need at least one of them further down the line. Another factor to consider is that saving it for later means you\\'ll play it when teams have a tighter schedule (cups and European competitions) increasing the rotation risk.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nI will probably try to use it straight after wildcarding and use barely any funds to play it.

And, inevitably, there were superficial comparisons of Firmino with Ekitike after the win over Yokohama. Variously roaming into deeper positions and running in behind, the Frenchman also produced a flicked effort on goal that most definitely had echoes of ‘Bobby’.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all good: he still looked like he was getting up to speed and appeared a little lost at times. But heck, it’s his first outing of the summer, in ridiculously hot weather, with a new bunch of teammates. Let’s spare any more knee-jerk judgment for now.\\n\\nWIRTZ IMPRESSES\\n\\nSomeone who very much is looking the part already is Florian Wirtz (£8.5m). After leading the line at the weekend, here he was in the ’10’ role that perhaps better suits him. That saw Dominik Szoboszlai (£6.5m) move into a deeper midfield position, the one typically occupied by Alexis Mac Allister (£6.5m), alongside Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m).\\n\\nArne Slot will love Wirtz’s off-the-ball contributions. Purists will love his touch and on-point passing. But FPL managers want end product – and a first Liverpool goal here was welcome in that sense.\\n\\nThe German arrived late in the box, Lampard-like, to sweep home Mohamed Salah‘s (£14.5m) cut-back, which had taken a touch off Curtis Jones (£5.5m) on the way.\\n\\nWirtz was also on corners, albeit with most of his deliveries (from either side) being nodded away. Still, set-piece responsibilities, or at least a share of them, would be welcome.\\n\\nSALAH THE CREATOR\\n\\nHow many times have we heard over the years that Salah is too wide and it’s the death knell for his FPL potential?\\n\\nThe Egyptian has been written off more times than Rocky Balboa but still keeps boinging back, and is fresh from a record-setting 2024/25 campaign. Here he was more creator than goal threat, unfortunate not to get an assist for Wirtz’s goal and deprived of another when Darwin Nunez missed an absolutely sitter.\\n\\nIt’ll still be worth monitoring Slot’s tactics and personnel choices over the coming weeks. It’s noticeable how much Conor Bradley (£5.0m) has been ‘underlapping’ in pre-season, popping up as a right-sided 10 with Salah outside of him. There was more of that in Japan.\\n\\nBut if you throw Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m) into the equation, for instance, Salah’s role changes, as the Dutchman seems more of a width-holder. It was from Frimpong’s inch-perfect cross that Trey Nyoni (£4.5m) prodded in Liverpool’s second.\\n\\nCody Gakpo (£7.5m) was more of a threat on the opposite flank, with Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) less of a space invader: the winger hit the post and saw a one-on-one chance snuffed out.\\n\\nDIAZ DEPARTS, ANOTHER STAR IS BORN?\\n\\nLiverpool are one left-winger down now that Luis Diaz (£8.0m) has departed for Bayern Munich.\\n\\nDo they even need to replace the Colombian in the transfer market, however?\\n\\nRio Ngumoha, who isn’t even listed in FPL, has been the breakout star of the summer. Replacing Gakpo on the left in the second half, the teenager again dazzled with his trickery, going inside and out.\\n\\nAnd a third attacking return of pre-season arrived late on when he collected Andrew Robertson‘s (£6.0m) pass, drove upfield and infield, and fired in Liverpool’s third of the night.\\n\\nAs you would expect, Slot is keen to keep the 16-year-old grounded – but we may have a future FPL star in the making here.\\n\\n“Rio again showed the quality he has and that’s nice for us because we have a lot of very good players.\\n\\n“To get some very good players through the Academy is always helpful and always gives energy to a team as well. It’s always nice to see young players from 16, 17 or 18 years old already impacting a game.\\n\\n“There was also a moment in the game where he should have squared it to Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] or Curtis. So, [there were] also learning parts for him. If you are 16 and you can impact the game like he did, that’s definitely worth a compliment.” – Arne Slot\\n\\nALISSON ABSENCE EXPLAINED\\n\\nThere was no Alisson (£5.5m) here, with Giorgi Mamardashvili (£4.5m) handed the full game.\\n\\nDon’t get too excited about the prospect of a £4.5m starting Liverpool ‘keeper, however: Alisson was only absent for personal reasons.\\n\\n“He had to go back to Brazil for private reasons.\\n\\n“That’s far from ideal – first of all for the private reasons, second of all for him to not be there in a game like this and in pre-season it’s also not ideal if you miss out on part of the pre-season.\\n\\n“But again, private life is more important in these matters than joining a game today.” – Arne Slot on Alisson\\n\\nDefensively, Liverpool again didn’t convince – they particularly looked susceptible to breaks. It’s an exciting squad that Slot is assembling for 2025/26 but the creases still need ironing out at the back.\\n\\nLiverpool XI: Mamardashvili, Bradley (Frimpong 64), van Dijk (Endo 59), Konate (Tsimikas 64), Kerkez (Robertson 64), Gravenberch (Jones 46), Szoboszlai (Elliott 64), Wirtz (Mac Allister 64), Salah (Nyoni 64), Ekitike (Nunez 46), Gakpo (Ngumoha 64).\\n\\nTEAM K LEAGUE 1-0 NEWCASTLE UNITED\\n\\nAnother soul-deflating defeat for the Magpies amid dispiriting off-the-field events but, as is the case elsewhere in pre-season, context is key.\\n\\nOnly four of the 10 starting outfielders sent out in the searing heat of Suwon are what you would call likely 2025/26 starters: Tino Livramento (£5.0m), Sandro Tonali (£5.5m), Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) and new boy Anthony Elanga (£7.0m).\\n\\nEven the substitutes brought on in South Korea were all rookies.\\n\\nSo, no surprise that, with the temperature in the mid-30s and the team understrength, Newcastle were anaemic.\\n\\nOSULA NOT THE ANSWER\\n\\nElanga was arguably the brightest spark, seeing a first-half effort tipped over and teeing up Will Osula (£5.5m) for a couple of chances after the interval. Fellow summer signing Seung-soo Park, a teenager expected to hook up with the B team in 2025/26, was also lively in a late cameo.\\n\\nBut all this friendly did was ram home how much the Magpies need a striker. Callum Wilson is gone, and Alexander Isak (£10.5m) is presumably following suit. Osula, based on the evidence of this summer, is a long way from being the answer.\\n\\nA frustrating, chance-wasting evening in Korea was capped off by his 80th-minute withdrawal, with Gordon going up front for the remainder. If we had to guess how Eddie Howe would line up in Gameweek 1 with no Isak or any replacement aboard, it’d probably be with Gordon through the middle.\\n\\nReports in the media on Wednesday claimed that Isak is currently working on his fitness at his former club, Real Sociedad.\\n\\nBOTMAN INJURY UPDATE\\n\\nAt the back, Nick Pope (£5.0m) was solid amid talk that Aaron Ramsdale is coming aboard. He could do little about Team K League’s winner.\\n\\nSven Botman (£5.0m) missed this match with a relatively minor issue, while Joe Willock (£5.0m) came off late on with what looked like a more serious ankle injury.\\n\\nThe good news, however, is that Lewis Hall (£5.5m) is fit (sort of) again: he was an unused substitute here.\\n\\nNewcastle United XI: Pope (M.Thompson 72), Livramento, A. Murphy, Lascelles, Krafth (Ashby 72), Tonali (Hernes 77), Willock (Al. Harrison 90), L. Miley, Osula (Park 82), Elanga, Gordon.\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

It would be typical Arteta to bring Gyokeres slowly and give him his 1st starting spot after the international break. Saka is a no go because I already have 3 heavy priced mids. Last 6 seasons averaged almost 4 goals in this fixture, so yes you\\'re right especially if one team looks to have the better edge, definitely captain material.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\ncravencottage\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n14 Years\\n\\n5 days, 3 hours ago\\n\\nFirst one this year.

Van de Ven looks like Spurs’ best defender. Havertz, as usual, invisible and useless. Kudus has shown nothing in pre-season - Tel might even start GW1. Spurs look expectedly better defensively under Frank.

Haaland, by contrast, is owned by only 18 per cent of managers.\\n\\nCreate your squad NOW\\n\\nThis means that Salah is near-certain to be the most-popular captain in the opening few Gameweeks of the season.\\n\\nIf you go without Salah and he delivers a huge haul at home against AFC Bournemouth in Gameweek 1, the impact would be far more detrimental to your overall rank than if the same thing happened with Haaland.\\n\\nIt is, quite simply, an unnecessary risk to take at the very start of the season.\\n\\nOf course, you could choose to own Salah AND Haaland. Indeed, the article below contains a squad that shows how you can afford them both. But it also underlines the fact that spending £28.5m on only two players forces you to make significant sacrifices across the rest of your squad.\\n\\nHere below are two examples of squads that you could pick if you go WITHOUT Haaland.\\n\\n1) Spend big in attack\\n\\nBy foregoing Haaland and spending big in attack, you could have Chelsea’s Cole Palmer (£10.5m), Arsenal’s Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) and Salah’s new team-mate at Liverpool, Florian Wirtz (£8.5m).\\n\\nPalmer and Wirtz are also among the three most-owned midfielders, alongside Salah, picked by more than 51 and 35 per cent respectively.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gyokeres has quickly become the third most-popular forward, with 23 per cent ownership.\\n\\nCrucially, Palmer is a great captain alternative to Salah, with Chelsea avoiding ALL of last season’s top eight teams in the first six Gameweeks.\\n\\nSee the Fixture Difficulty Ratings for every club\\n\\nIf you go without Haaland you could also pick Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye (£6.5m), who has great opening fixtures too.\\n\\nLike Salah and Palmer, Ndiaye takes penalties for his club - and Gyokeres, Tottenham Hotspur’s Dominic Solanke (£7.5m) and Brighton & Hove Albion’s Danny Welbeck (£6.5m) could also emerge as their club’s new penalty-takers this season.\\n\\nIf you're spending so much of your budget in attack, you'll need to identify budget-friendly players with very favourable early runs of opponents.\\n\\nAt £4.5m, Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, Spurs centre-back Micky van de Ven and West Ham United full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka can offer excellent value over many Gameweeks.\\n\\nThis leaves Nottingham Forest’s Nikola Milenkovic (£5.5m) as the only non-budget defender in the suggested squad below. The centre-back would have placed first for points among defenders in Fantasy last season if the new defensive contribution points had been added.\\n\\n2) Get a balanced squad\\n\\nAlternatively, you could reinvest the Haaland funds across your entire squad and strengthen every area, reducing your reliance on the performance of cheap players.\\n\\nIn contrast to the squad suggested above, this second squad has two premium defenders - Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk (£6.0m) and Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly (£5.5m). You could then rotate Wan-Bissaka and Van de Ven in the third spot, picking whichever player has the better fixture in a given Gameweek.\\n\\nGoalkeeper Matz Sels (£5.0m) offers a cheaper route into Nottingham Forest’s rearguard than Milenkovic ahead of the club's favourable run of opponents.\\n\\nAccording to the Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR), where the difficulty of each fixture is ranked from one to five, with one being the easiest possible match and five being the hardest, Forest’s average of 2.67 over the first six Gameweeks is the joint-best of any side.\\n\\nSee who has the best and worst early fixtures\\n\\nIn midfield, Salah and Palmer are the premium players in this squad, with Ndiaye joined by Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers (£7.0m), who is £2.0m less expensive than Villa forward Ollie Watkins (£9.0m).\\n\\nAlongside Solanke up front, you could have West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen (£8.0m) and Forest’s Chris Wood (£7.5m). Both were ranked among the six top-scoring players in 2024/25 yet they only cost a combined £15.5m, just £1.5m more expensive than Haaland costs by himself.\\n\\nSimilarly to Solanke, they can offer fine value from the outset thanks to their kind early schedules.\\n\\nSee FPL experts' squads\\n\\nFeatured\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2025/07/31/fpl-notes-ekitike-debut-wirtz-goal-alisson-absence-explained?hc_page=1&hc_sort_by=comment_date', 'query': 'FPL rotation risk players starting XI updates', 'category': 'team'}, page_content='Win at FPL with an FFS Membership · Save 47% with our Early Bird Offer, just £1.25 a Gameweek!\\n\\nSign Up Now\\n\\nJoin Scout\\n\\nJoin Scout\\n\\nFPL 2025/26 Ultimate Guide\\n\\nGameweek 2 Guide\\n\\n25/26 Pre-season Guide\\n\\nSet-Piece Takers\\n\\nEFL Fixture Tickers\\n\\nMore on EFL.com >>\\n\\nAll Articles\\n\\nFPL Team Reveals\\n\\nCaptaincy Picks\\n\\nPremium Articles\\n\\nFPL Experts Articles\\n\\nScout Notes (Matches)\\n\\nScout Reports (Players)\\n\\nCommunity Articles\\n\\nEliteserien\\n\\nFantasy EFL\\n\\nSign up Now -

And, inevitably, there were superficial comparisons of Firmino with Ekitike after the win over Yokohama. Variously roaming into deeper positions and running in behind, the Frenchman also produced a flicked effort on goal that most definitely had echoes of ‘Bobby’.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all good: he still looked like he was getting up to speed and appeared a little lost at times. But heck, it’s his first outing of the summer, in ridiculously hot weather, with a new bunch of teammates. Let’s spare any more knee-jerk judgment for now.\\n\\nWIRTZ IMPRESSES\\n\\nSomeone who very much is looking the part already is Florian Wirtz (£8.5m). After leading the line at the weekend, here he was in the ’10’ role that perhaps better suits him. That saw Dominik Szoboszlai (£6.5m) move into a deeper midfield position, the one typically occupied by Alexis Mac Allister (£6.5m), alongside Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m).\\n\\nArne Slot will love Wirtz’s off-the-ball contributions. Purists will love his touch and on-point passing. But FPL managers want end product – and a first Liverpool goal here was welcome in that sense.\\n\\nThe German arrived late in the box, Lampard-like, to sweep home Mohamed Salah‘s (£14.5m) cut-back, which had taken a touch off Curtis Jones (£5.5m) on the way.\\n\\nWirtz was also on corners, albeit with most of his deliveries (from either side) being nodded away. Still, set-piece responsibilities, or at least a share of them, would be welcome.\\n\\nSALAH THE CREATOR\\n\\nHow many times have we heard over the years that Salah is too wide and it’s the death knell for his FPL potential?\\n\\nThe Egyptian has been written off more times than Rocky Balboa but still keeps boinging back, and is fresh from a record-setting 2024/25 campaign. Here he was more creator than goal threat, unfortunate not to get an assist for Wirtz’s goal and deprived of another when Darwin Nunez missed an absolutely sitter.\\n\\nIt’ll still be worth monitoring Slot’s tactics and personnel choices over the coming weeks. It’s noticeable how much Conor Bradley (£5.0m) has been ‘underlapping’ in pre-season, popping up as a right-sided 10 with Salah outside of him. There was more of that in Japan.\\n\\nBut if you throw Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m) into the equation, for instance, Salah’s role changes, as the Dutchman seems more of a width-holder. It was from Frimpong’s inch-perfect cross that Trey Nyoni (£4.5m) prodded in Liverpool’s second.\\n\\nCody Gakpo (£7.5m) was more of a threat on the opposite flank, with Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) less of a space invader: the winger hit the post and saw a one-on-one chance snuffed out.\\n\\nDIAZ DEPARTS, ANOTHER STAR IS BORN?\\n\\nLiverpool are one left-winger down now that Luis Diaz (£8.0m) has departed for Bayern Munich.\\n\\nDo they even need to replace the Colombian in the transfer market, however?\\n\\nRio Ngumoha, who isn’t even listed in FPL, has been the breakout star of the summer. Replacing Gakpo on the left in the second half, the teenager again dazzled with his trickery, going inside and out.\\n\\nAnd a third attacking return of pre-season arrived late on when he collected Andrew Robertson‘s (£6.0m) pass, drove upfield and infield, and fired in Liverpool’s third of the night.\\n\\nAs you would expect, Slot is keen to keep the 16-year-old grounded – but we may have a future FPL star in the making here.\\n\\n“Rio again showed the quality he has and that’s nice for us because we have a lot of very good players.\\n\\n“To get some very good players through the Academy is always helpful and always gives energy to a team as well. It’s always nice to see young players from 16, 17 or 18 years old already impacting a game.\\n\\n“There was also a moment in the game where he should have squared it to Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] or Curtis. So, [there were] also learning parts for him. If you are 16 and you can impact the game like he did, that’s definitely worth a compliment.” – Arne Slot\\n\\nALISSON ABSENCE EXPLAINED\\n\\nThere was no Alisson (£5.5m) here, with Giorgi Mamardashvili (£4.5m) handed the full game.\\n\\nDon’t get too excited about the prospect of a £4.5m starting Liverpool ‘keeper, however: Alisson was only absent for personal reasons.\\n\\n“He had to go back to Brazil for private reasons.\\n\\n“That’s far from ideal – first of all for the private reasons, second of all for him to not be there in a game like this and in pre-season it’s also not ideal if you miss out on part of the pre-season.\\n\\n“But again, private life is more important in these matters than joining a game today.” – Arne Slot on Alisson\\n\\nDefensively, Liverpool again didn’t convince – they particularly looked susceptible to breaks. It’s an exciting squad that Slot is assembling for 2025/26 but the creases still need ironing out at the back.\\n\\nLiverpool XI: Mamardashvili, Bradley (Frimpong 64), van Dijk (Endo 59), Konate (Tsimikas 64), Kerkez (Robertson 64), Gravenberch (Jones 46), Szoboszlai (Elliott 64), Wirtz (Mac Allister 64), Salah (Nyoni 64), Ekitike (Nunez 46), Gakpo (Ngumoha 64).\\n\\nTEAM K LEAGUE 1-0 NEWCASTLE UNITED\\n\\nAnother soul-deflating defeat for the Magpies amid dispiriting off-the-field events but, as is the case elsewhere in pre-season, context is key.\\n\\nOnly four of the 10 starting outfielders sent out in the searing heat of Suwon are what you would call likely 2025/26 starters: Tino Livramento (£5.0m), Sandro Tonali (£5.5m), Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) and new boy Anthony Elanga (£7.0m).\\n\\nEven the substitutes brought on in South Korea were all rookies.\\n\\nSo, no surprise that, with the temperature in the mid-30s and the team understrength, Newcastle were anaemic.\\n\\nOSULA NOT THE ANSWER\\n\\nElanga was arguably the brightest spark, seeing a first-half effort tipped over and teeing up Will Osula (£5.5m) for a couple of chances after the interval. Fellow summer signing Seung-soo Park, a teenager expected to hook up with the B team in 2025/26, was also lively in a late cameo.\\n\\nBut all this friendly did was ram home how much the Magpies need a striker. Callum Wilson is gone, and Alexander Isak (£10.5m) is presumably following suit. Osula, based on the evidence of this summer, is a long way from being the answer.\\n\\nA frustrating, chance-wasting evening in Korea was capped off by his 80th-minute withdrawal, with Gordon going up front for the remainder. If we had to guess how Eddie Howe would line up in Gameweek 1 with no Isak or any replacement aboard, it’d probably be with Gordon through the middle.\\n\\nReports in the media on Wednesday claimed that Isak is currently working on his fitness at his former club, Real Sociedad.\\n\\nBOTMAN INJURY UPDATE\\n\\nAt the back, Nick Pope (£5.0m) was solid amid talk that Aaron Ramsdale is coming aboard. He could do little about Team K League’s winner.\\n\\nSven Botman (£5.0m) missed this match with a relatively minor issue, while Joe Willock (£5.0m) came off late on with what looked like a more serious ankle injury.\\n\\nThe good news, however, is that Lewis Hall (£5.5m) is fit (sort of) again: he was an unused substitute here.\\n\\nNewcastle United XI: Pope (M.Thompson 72), Livramento, A. Murphy, Lascelles, Krafth (Ashby 72), Tonali (Hernes 77), Willock (Al. Harrison 90), L. Miley, Osula (Park 82), Elanga, Gordon.\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

It would be typical Arteta to bring Gyokeres slowly and give him his 1st starting spot after the international break. Saka is a no go because I already have 3 heavy priced mids. Last 6 seasons averaged almost 4 goals in this fixture, so yes you\\'re right especially if one team looks to have the better edge, definitely captain material.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\ncravencottage\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n14 Years\\n\\n5 days, 3 hours ago\\n\\nFirst one this year.

Van de Ven looks like Spurs’ best defender. Havertz, as usual, invisible and useless. Kudus has shown nothing in pre-season - Tel might even start GW1. Spurs look expectedly better defensively under Frank.

Meaningless (as is the PFA award, as evidenced when De Bruyne won it last). He\\'s obviously a good player, but Arteta\\'s system is crippling his output - he\\'s stuck in this Bruno-like role where he\\'s being forced to do both the build-up and the final ball because none of his teammates can do it.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nNightcrawler\\n\\n6 Years\\n\\n5 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nI agree with everything, and I\\'ve never considered him a decent FPL pick.

What price structure you go with also has a lot to do with the flexibility of squad as well. Let us break this down with the example of my current premiums.\\n\\nIn my current draft (which is far away from my final one), I have Mohamed Salah (£14.5m), Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) in my team.\\n\\nLet me explain the reasoning behind the same, starting with captaincy.\\n\\nSalah is an opening-day monster who is a good option to cover Gameweeks 1, 4 and 5. His fixtures in Gameweeks 2 and 3 are not the best on paper, which is why it might be helpful to find captaincy options in those Gameweeks.\\n\\nPalmer does a good job of covering Gameweeks 2 and 3. He’s got a decent run of fixtures at the start of the season, which really turns great from Gameweek 9 onwards.\\n\\nWhat stands out in Gameweek 2, though, is that Arsenal face Leeds United at home. If I can help it, I want to have a captaincy option from the Gunners in that week, which is why I’m thinking of including either Gyokeres or Bukayo Saka (£10.0m). Now, Palmer against West Ham United (away) or Salah against Newcastle United (away) are perfectly good captaincy options. That fixture against Leeds just stands out. however.\\n\\nHAALAND’S CASE FOR INCLUSION\\n\\nAlternatively, if you look at Erling Haaland’s (£14.0m) fixtures, he’s a good captaincy option in most weeks except Gameweek 5. There’s certainly a case to make to start the season with him, should you choose to do it.\\n\\nThe real appealing match-up for Haaland, though, is the fixture in Gameweek 6 at home to Burnley. He is definitely the best captaincy option that week. From that point, he’s got a good run of fixtures and it would be very handy to have him from Gameweeks 6 to 10.\\n\\nThis is where the flexibility and team structure come in. By virtue of owning two of the most expensive midfielders in Salah and Palmer, your team automatically becomes a little more flexible. Simply put, if you’re cash isn’t distributed and is instead condensed amongst some of the premiums, it should take fewer moves to get to another heavy hitter. To make it even simpler: it is easier to sell Salah than to buy him.\\n\\nThat is why a punt on Gyokeres (it is very much a punt at this stage) is an idea I am considering right now, so that I have money constricted in my squad in three places. This makes it easier to distribute and buy a certain Norwegian in Gameweek 6 if I choose to go there.\\n\\nGyokeres can very much be Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), too, given his fixtures at the start of the season. We can’t confidently say that Gyokeres is nailed on to start the first two games (as of now), given the presence of Kai Havertz (£7.5m) and the fact that Gyokeres has joined training late. We don’t even know how quickly he’ll bed in with his new teammates.\\n\\nINFORMATION OVERLOAD\\n\\nSpeaking of knowing things, I feel like there is so much information to obtain at the start of the season that it is important to be agile while picking your squad. Think about it: we’ve had more turnover at the top clubs than in any other season in recent memory.\\n\\nLiverpool alone could have two or three new players in their front four and two new players in their back five. We don’t have reliable information yet on who the picks at Manchester City might be outside of Haaland, given the number of options there. We don’t know who is going to be on penalties between Saka or Gyokeres. Spurs have a new manager.\\n\\nThere is simply a lot to learn, especially with little to no pre-season for Manchester City and Chelsea. We don’t quite realise how much information is going to hit us in the first few weeks, which is why being flexible and not being handcuffed is important.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by handcuffs? I refer to the Bench Boost. If I can help it, I really want to utilise my Bench Boost before I use my first Wildcard. If you haven’t already seen Pras’ chip strategy video, I highly recommend it:\\n\\nWHEN TO WILDCARD?\\n\\nGiven the barrage of information that we might receive in the first few weeks, my approach to a Wildcard is to be agile between Gameweeks 6 and 13. Let’s have a quick look at the landscape:\\n\\nArsenal have a great run from Gameweek 7 onwards and Chelsea from Gameweek 9 onwards. While Liverpool and Manchester City have very appealing schedules from Gameweek 13, their matches from Gameweeks 8/6 respectively are not bad at all.\\n\\nGiven the number of expensive assets from these teams that we’ll need together, team value might be very important this season. In addition, to afford more of these players in your team, you will need to make sure you don’t spread your funds and spend them on the pitch.\\n\\nWhile the teams to target on a Gameweek 13 Wildcard will be City and Liverpool, going early on these assets, given their fixtures, won’t be a bad idea.\\n\\nThat is why I have an agile approach to a Wildcard between Gameweeks 6 and 13 based on how confident I am with what I’ve learned in the first few Gameweeks and provided I’ve used my Bench Boost.\\n\\nBENCH BOOST BEFORE WILDCARD\\n\\nIf I’ve used my Bench Boost before my Wildcard (which is what I really want to do), I will be able to go bottom price on my second ‘keeper, fifth defender and eighth attacker, which means I am not spreading my funds and spending them on the pitch instead. That will allow me to get a higher chunk of expensive assets from good teams. I can always spread funds around during AFCON once Salah leaves to help deal with the Christmas rotation.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I am looking at an early Bench Boost. Which week for that chip is something I will explore in a later article.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this one!\\n\\nPosted by lateriser12 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n325 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFodderx4\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nMorning All, how is this looking for now? 442 is currently appealing to me before as can see the premium defenders outscoring midfielders and forwards upto 6m.

I have always placed huge emphasis on getting things pretty right for GW 1 but this year is particularly challenging. The uncertainty (player movement, new to PL, new coaches, players with huge reputations, traps), there is a need to be cautious. I have read a lot of thoughts about BB in GW1 and feel that this may be premature. I will attempt to bank a few transfers and launch BB around weeks 4 or 5. That will then give me some time to reset for a wildcard around 10-13.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAaa\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nWhat to change here?

Waiting lets you see if there\\'s any good cheapies available. Not just that but increases the likelihood of an early wildcard, as when you see that extra cash on the bench you\\'ll want to put it on the pitch\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nEarly wildcard of course might be the play though if Isak ends up at Liverpool GW4, etc\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Mal\\n\\n1 Year\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nThere\\'s two sides to that. If you don\\'t play it early, then it could disrupt your planning, at some point you might have to spend a transfer on your 2nd keeper/5th defender/8th attacker instead of focusing on higher upside moves. The main negatives of an early BB are definitely the lack of info and the lower team value. However, starting without Salah and Haaland seems more viable than other years making it easier to spread the funds, but we\\'ll most likely need at least one of them further down the line. Another factor to consider is that saving it for later means you\\'ll play it when teams have a tighter schedule (cups and European competitions) increasing the rotation risk.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nI will probably try to use it straight after wildcarding and use barely any funds to play it.

What price structure you go with also has a lot to do with the flexibility of squad as well. Let us break this down with the example of my current premiums.\\n\\nIn my current draft (which is far away from my final one), I have Mohamed Salah (£14.5m), Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) in my team.\\n\\nLet me explain the reasoning behind the same, starting with captaincy.\\n\\nSalah is an opening-day monster who is a good option to cover Gameweeks 1, 4 and 5. His fixtures in Gameweeks 2 and 3 are not the best on paper, which is why it might be helpful to find captaincy options in those Gameweeks.\\n\\nPalmer does a good job of covering Gameweeks 2 and 3. He’s got a decent run of fixtures at the start of the season, which really turns great from Gameweek 9 onwards.\\n\\nWhat stands out in Gameweek 2, though, is that Arsenal face Leeds United at home. If I can help it, I want to have a captaincy option from the Gunners in that week, which is why I’m thinking of including either Gyokeres or Bukayo Saka (£10.0m). Now, Palmer against West Ham United (away) or Salah against Newcastle United (away) are perfectly good captaincy options. That fixture against Leeds just stands out. however.\\n\\nHAALAND’S CASE FOR INCLUSION\\n\\nAlternatively, if you look at Erling Haaland’s (£14.0m) fixtures, he’s a good captaincy option in most weeks except Gameweek 5. There’s certainly a case to make to start the season with him, should you choose to do it.\\n\\nThe real appealing match-up for Haaland, though, is the fixture in Gameweek 6 at home to Burnley. He is definitely the best captaincy option that week. From that point, he’s got a good run of fixtures and it would be very handy to have him from Gameweeks 6 to 10.\\n\\nThis is where the flexibility and team structure come in. By virtue of owning two of the most expensive midfielders in Salah and Palmer, your team automatically becomes a little more flexible. Simply put, if you’re cash isn’t distributed and is instead condensed amongst some of the premiums, it should take fewer moves to get to another heavy hitter. To make it even simpler: it is easier to sell Salah than to buy him.\\n\\nThat is why a punt on Gyokeres (it is very much a punt at this stage) is an idea I am considering right now, so that I have money constricted in my squad in three places. This makes it easier to distribute and buy a certain Norwegian in Gameweek 6 if I choose to go there.\\n\\nGyokeres can very much be Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), too, given his fixtures at the start of the season. We can’t confidently say that Gyokeres is nailed on to start the first two games (as of now), given the presence of Kai Havertz (£7.5m) and the fact that Gyokeres has joined training late. We don’t even know how quickly he’ll bed in with his new teammates.\\n\\nINFORMATION OVERLOAD\\n\\nSpeaking of knowing things, I feel like there is so much information to obtain at the start of the season that it is important to be agile while picking your squad. Think about it: we’ve had more turnover at the top clubs than in any other season in recent memory.\\n\\nLiverpool alone could have two or three new players in their front four and two new players in their back five. We don’t have reliable information yet on who the picks at Manchester City might be outside of Haaland, given the number of options there. We don’t know who is going to be on penalties between Saka or Gyokeres. Spurs have a new manager.\\n\\nThere is simply a lot to learn, especially with little to no pre-season for Manchester City and Chelsea. We don’t quite realise how much information is going to hit us in the first few weeks, which is why being flexible and not being handcuffed is important.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by handcuffs? I refer to the Bench Boost. If I can help it, I really want to utilise my Bench Boost before I use my first Wildcard. If you haven’t already seen Pras’ chip strategy video, I highly recommend it:\\n\\nWHEN TO WILDCARD?\\n\\nGiven the barrage of information that we might receive in the first few weeks, my approach to a Wildcard is to be agile between Gameweeks 6 and 13. Let’s have a quick look at the landscape:\\n\\nArsenal have a great run from Gameweek 7 onwards and Chelsea from Gameweek 9 onwards. While Liverpool and Manchester City have very appealing schedules from Gameweek 13, their matches from Gameweeks 8/6 respectively are not bad at all.\\n\\nGiven the number of expensive assets from these teams that we’ll need together, team value might be very important this season. In addition, to afford more of these players in your team, you will need to make sure you don’t spread your funds and spend them on the pitch.\\n\\nWhile the teams to target on a Gameweek 13 Wildcard will be City and Liverpool, going early on these assets, given their fixtures, won’t be a bad idea.\\n\\nThat is why I have an agile approach to a Wildcard between Gameweeks 6 and 13 based on how confident I am with what I’ve learned in the first few Gameweeks and provided I’ve used my Bench Boost.\\n\\nBENCH BOOST BEFORE WILDCARD\\n\\nIf I’ve used my Bench Boost before my Wildcard (which is what I really want to do), I will be able to go bottom price on my second ‘keeper, fifth defender and eighth attacker, which means I am not spreading my funds and spending them on the pitch instead. That will allow me to get a higher chunk of expensive assets from good teams. I can always spread funds around during AFCON once Salah leaves to help deal with the Christmas rotation.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I am looking at an early Bench Boost. Which week for that chip is something I will explore in a later article.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this one!\\n\\nPosted by lateriser12 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n325 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFodderx4\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nMorning All, how is this looking for now? 442 is currently appealing to me before as can see the premium defenders outscoring midfielders and forwards upto 6m.

I have always placed huge emphasis on getting things pretty right for GW 1 but this year is particularly challenging. The uncertainty (player movement, new to PL, new coaches, players with huge reputations, traps), there is a need to be cautious. I have read a lot of thoughts about BB in GW1 and feel that this may be premature. I will attempt to bank a few transfers and launch BB around weeks 4 or 5. That will then give me some time to reset for a wildcard around 10-13.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAaa\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nWhat to change here?

Waiting lets you see if there\\'s any good cheapies available. Not just that but increases the likelihood of an early wildcard, as when you see that extra cash on the bench you\\'ll want to put it on the pitch\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nEarly wildcard of course might be the play though if Isak ends up at Liverpool GW4, etc\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Mal\\n\\n1 Year\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nThere\\'s two sides to that. If you don\\'t play it early, then it could disrupt your planning, at some point you might have to spend a transfer on your 2nd keeper/5th defender/8th attacker instead of focusing on higher upside moves. The main negatives of an early BB are definitely the lack of info and the lower team value. However, starting without Salah and Haaland seems more viable than other years making it easier to spread the funds, but we\\'ll most likely need at least one of them further down the line. Another factor to consider is that saving it for later means you\\'ll play it when teams have a tighter schedule (cups and European competitions) increasing the rotation risk.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nI will probably try to use it straight after wildcarding and use barely any funds to play it.

And, inevitably, there were superficial comparisons of Firmino with Ekitike after the win over Yokohama. Variously roaming into deeper positions and running in behind, the Frenchman also produced a flicked effort on goal that most definitely had echoes of ‘Bobby’.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all good: he still looked like he was getting up to speed and appeared a little lost at times. But heck, it’s his first outing of the summer, in ridiculously hot weather, with a new bunch of teammates. Let’s spare any more knee-jerk judgment for now.\\n\\nWIRTZ IMPRESSES\\n\\nSomeone who very much is looking the part already is Florian Wirtz (£8.5m). After leading the line at the weekend, here he was in the ’10’ role that perhaps better suits him. That saw Dominik Szoboszlai (£6.5m) move into a deeper midfield position, the one typically occupied by Alexis Mac Allister (£6.5m), alongside Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m).\\n\\nArne Slot will love Wirtz’s off-the-ball contributions. Purists will love his touch and on-point passing. But FPL managers want end product – and a first Liverpool goal here was welcome in that sense.\\n\\nThe German arrived late in the box, Lampard-like, to sweep home Mohamed Salah‘s (£14.5m) cut-back, which had taken a touch off Curtis Jones (£5.5m) on the way.\\n\\nWirtz was also on corners, albeit with most of his deliveries (from either side) being nodded away. Still, set-piece responsibilities, or at least a share of them, would be welcome.\\n\\nSALAH THE CREATOR\\n\\nHow many times have we heard over the years that Salah is too wide and it’s the death knell for his FPL potential?\\n\\nThe Egyptian has been written off more times than Rocky Balboa but still keeps boinging back, and is fresh from a record-setting 2024/25 campaign. Here he was more creator than goal threat, unfortunate not to get an assist for Wirtz’s goal and deprived of another when Darwin Nunez missed an absolutely sitter.\\n\\nIt’ll still be worth monitoring Slot’s tactics and personnel choices over the coming weeks. It’s noticeable how much Conor Bradley (£5.0m) has been ‘underlapping’ in pre-season, popping up as a right-sided 10 with Salah outside of him. There was more of that in Japan.\\n\\nBut if you throw Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m) into the equation, for instance, Salah’s role changes, as the Dutchman seems more of a width-holder. It was from Frimpong’s inch-perfect cross that Trey Nyoni (£4.5m) prodded in Liverpool’s second.\\n\\nCody Gakpo (£7.5m) was more of a threat on the opposite flank, with Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) less of a space invader: the winger hit the post and saw a one-on-one chance snuffed out.\\n\\nDIAZ DEPARTS, ANOTHER STAR IS BORN?\\n\\nLiverpool are one left-winger down now that Luis Diaz (£8.0m) has departed for Bayern Munich.\\n\\nDo they even need to replace the Colombian in the transfer market, however?\\n\\nRio Ngumoha, who isn’t even listed in FPL, has been the breakout star of the summer. Replacing Gakpo on the left in the second half, the teenager again dazzled with his trickery, going inside and out.\\n\\nAnd a third attacking return of pre-season arrived late on when he collected Andrew Robertson‘s (£6.0m) pass, drove upfield and infield, and fired in Liverpool’s third of the night.\\n\\nAs you would expect, Slot is keen to keep the 16-year-old grounded – but we may have a future FPL star in the making here.\\n\\n“Rio again showed the quality he has and that’s nice for us because we have a lot of very good players.\\n\\n“To get some very good players through the Academy is always helpful and always gives energy to a team as well. It’s always nice to see young players from 16, 17 or 18 years old already impacting a game.\\n\\n“There was also a moment in the game where he should have squared it to Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] or Curtis. So, [there were] also learning parts for him. If you are 16 and you can impact the game like he did, that’s definitely worth a compliment.” – Arne Slot\\n\\nALISSON ABSENCE EXPLAINED\\n\\nThere was no Alisson (£5.5m) here, with Giorgi Mamardashvili (£4.5m) handed the full game.\\n\\nDon’t get too excited about the prospect of a £4.5m starting Liverpool ‘keeper, however: Alisson was only absent for personal reasons.\\n\\n“He had to go back to Brazil for private reasons.\\n\\n“That’s far from ideal – first of all for the private reasons, second of all for him to not be there in a game like this and in pre-season it’s also not ideal if you miss out on part of the pre-season.\\n\\n“But again, private life is more important in these matters than joining a game today.” – Arne Slot on Alisson\\n\\nDefensively, Liverpool again didn’t convince – they particularly looked susceptible to breaks. It’s an exciting squad that Slot is assembling for 2025/26 but the creases still need ironing out at the back.\\n\\nLiverpool XI: Mamardashvili, Bradley (Frimpong 64), van Dijk (Endo 59), Konate (Tsimikas 64), Kerkez (Robertson 64), Gravenberch (Jones 46), Szoboszlai (Elliott 64), Wirtz (Mac Allister 64), Salah (Nyoni 64), Ekitike (Nunez 46), Gakpo (Ngumoha 64).\\n\\nTEAM K LEAGUE 1-0 NEWCASTLE UNITED\\n\\nAnother soul-deflating defeat for the Magpies amid dispiriting off-the-field events but, as is the case elsewhere in pre-season, context is key.\\n\\nOnly four of the 10 starting outfielders sent out in the searing heat of Suwon are what you would call likely 2025/26 starters: Tino Livramento (£5.0m), Sandro Tonali (£5.5m), Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) and new boy Anthony Elanga (£7.0m).\\n\\nEven the substitutes brought on in South Korea were all rookies.\\n\\nSo, no surprise that, with the temperature in the mid-30s and the team understrength, Newcastle were anaemic.\\n\\nOSULA NOT THE ANSWER\\n\\nElanga was arguably the brightest spark, seeing a first-half effort tipped over and teeing up Will Osula (£5.5m) for a couple of chances after the interval. Fellow summer signing Seung-soo Park, a teenager expected to hook up with the B team in 2025/26, was also lively in a late cameo.\\n\\nBut all this friendly did was ram home how much the Magpies need a striker. Callum Wilson is gone, and Alexander Isak (£10.5m) is presumably following suit. Osula, based on the evidence of this summer, is a long way from being the answer.\\n\\nA frustrating, chance-wasting evening in Korea was capped off by his 80th-minute withdrawal, with Gordon going up front for the remainder. If we had to guess how Eddie Howe would line up in Gameweek 1 with no Isak or any replacement aboard, it’d probably be with Gordon through the middle.\\n\\nReports in the media on Wednesday claimed that Isak is currently working on his fitness at his former club, Real Sociedad.\\n\\nBOTMAN INJURY UPDATE\\n\\nAt the back, Nick Pope (£5.0m) was solid amid talk that Aaron Ramsdale is coming aboard. He could do little about Team K League’s winner.\\n\\nSven Botman (£5.0m) missed this match with a relatively minor issue, while Joe Willock (£5.0m) came off late on with what looked like a more serious ankle injury.\\n\\nThe good news, however, is that Lewis Hall (£5.5m) is fit (sort of) again: he was an unused substitute here.\\n\\nNewcastle United XI: Pope (M.Thompson 72), Livramento, A. Murphy, Lascelles, Krafth (Ashby 72), Tonali (Hernes 77), Willock (Al. Harrison 90), L. Miley, Osula (Park 82), Elanga, Gordon.\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

It would be typical Arteta to bring Gyokeres slowly and give him his 1st starting spot after the international break. Saka is a no go because I already have 3 heavy priced mids. Last 6 seasons averaged almost 4 goals in this fixture, so yes you\\'re right especially if one team looks to have the better edge, definitely captain material.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\ncravencottage\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n14 Years\\n\\n5 days, 3 hours ago\\n\\nFirst one this year.

Van de Ven looks like Spurs’ best defender. Havertz, as usual, invisible and useless. Kudus has shown nothing in pre-season - Tel might even start GW1. Spurs look expectedly better defensively under Frank.

During your draft, when your turn comes, if you don\\'t select a player manually then the computer will automatically snap up the top player who is on your Watchlist and is still available.\\n\\nSo you could put these 50 players on your Watchlist in this order now!\\n\\nMohamed Salah (Liverpool midfielder)\\n\\nCole Palmer (Chelsea midfielder)\\n\\nErling Haaland (Man City forward)\\n\\nBukayo Saka (Arsenal midfielder)\\n\\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle forward)\\n\\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa forward)\\n\\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal forward)\\n\\nBryan Mbeumo (Man Utd midfielder)\\n\\nBruno Fernandes (Man Utd midfielder)\\n\\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool midfielder)\\n\\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool forward)\\n\\nMatheus Cunha (Man Utd midfielder)\\n\\nEberechi Eze (Crystal Palace midfielder)\\n\\nJarrod Bowen (West Ham forward)\\n\\nEvanilson (Bournemouth forward)\\n\\nYoane Wissa (Brentford forward)\\n\\nJosko Gvardiol (Man City defender)\\n\\nDominic Solanke (Spurs forward)\\n\\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool defender)\\n\\nGabriel (Arsenal defender)\\n\\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa midfielder)\\n\\nMartin Odegaard (Arsenal midfielder)\\n\\nMorgan Gibbs-White (Nott\\'m Forest midfielder)\\n\\nJean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace forward)\\n\\nChris Wood (Nott\\'m Forest forward)\\n\\nJordan Pickford (Everton goalkeeper)\\n\\nMohammed Kudus (Spurs midfielder)\\n\\nNikola Milenkovic (Nott\\'m Forest defender)\\n\\nJeremie Frimpong (Liverpool defender)\\n\\nWilliam Saliba (Arsenal defender)\\n\\nMurillo (Nott\\'m Forest defender)\\n\\nPhil Foden (Man City midfielder)\\n\\nIliman Ndiaye (Everton midfielder)\\n\\nJustin Kluivert (Bournemouth midfielder)\\n\\nJames Tarkowski (Everton defender)\\n\\nAntonee Robinson (Fulham defender)\\n\\nAmad (Man Utd midfielder)\\n\\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton midfielder)\\n\\nYouri Tielemans (Aston Villa midfielder)\\n\\nMaxence Lacroix (Crystal Palace defender)\\n\\nJoao Pedro (Chelsea forward)\\n\\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal midfielder)\\n\\nAlisson Becker (Liverpool goalkeeper)\\n\\nAnthony Gordon (Newcastle midfielder)\\n\\nDavid Raya (Arsenal goalkeeper)\\n\\nMarc Cucurella (Chelsea defender)\\n\\nEnzo Fernandez (Chelsea midfielder)\\n\\nAaron Wan-Bissaka (West Ham defender)\\n\\nMatz Sels (Nott\\'m Forest goalkeeper)\\n\\nNathan Collins (Brentford defender)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy0pkeyzwgo', 'query': 'FPL Scout best tips and advice latest', 'category': 'fpl'}, page_content=\"How to win at FPL - our experts give their best tips\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n9 hours ago\\n\\nThe Fantasy Premier League season is just around the corner and, with more managers taking part, achieving that elusive top-10k finish is proving harder than ever.\\n\\nThat's where BBC Sport's four FPL experts for 2025-26 can help.\\n\\nWe've compiled the best advice from Pras, Holly Shand, FPL Heisenberg and Gianni Buttice to help you get ahead of the game.\\n\\nAnd we've also spoken to Max Littleproud, winner of the BBC Sport FPL league last season with an incredible finish of fifth in the world.\\n\\nMax's approach to the game was a little different last season - if xG and underlying data leaves you cold then you might prefer his advice.\\n\\nYou can join the BBC Sport League on the official Fantasy Premier League game using the code bbcfpl - or by clicking this link, external.\\n\\nPrioritise long-term planning over short-term point chasing\\n\\nPRAS: A good FPL manager plays the game like chess. It isn't about who to pick this week or even next, a good manager looks at blocks of fixtures and targets players with good medium-term fixture runs. Doing so avoids knee-jerking on moves, especially for players that only have one good fixture and then a not-so-great run. Have a plan and stick to it as much as possible.\\n\\nHOLLY: Team form and upcoming fixture ease are two vitally important metrics to consider when making transfers. Keep a close eye on both when planning transfers, in order to pick up key players before their hot streak begins and steal a march on your rivals.\\n\\nBalance premium picks in your week one team\\n\\nHOLLY: It's important to strike the right balance of premium players, particularly at the start of the season when form is more unpredictable.\\n\\nFor greater transfer flexibility, try to pick a premium player in each position in your gameweek one team and then make a captaincy matrix for upcoming weeks to hone in on your key transfer targets.\\n\\nWhat's changed in FPL for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n19 hours ago\\n\\nHow to join BBC Sport's FPL league\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n1 day ago\\n\\nHow to follow FPL on BBC Sport in 2025-26 season\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n1 day ago\\n\\nDon't be stubborn when you've made a mistake\\n\\nHEISENBERG: You have to acknowledge when you've made an error by either bringing a player in you shouldn't have, or by ignoring a player in hot form that needs to come in.\\n\\nIt happens to us all - the key is to rectify these situations as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAvoid hits and early transfers\\n\\nGIANNI: It's better to roll transfers and go weeks without one if you can. Stay patient, use your bench if you need to and accumulate transfers. With several free transfers you can make significant changes to your team structure and make moves for even the most expensive assets without taking hits.\\n\\nHOLLY: I try to avoid early transfers wherever possible - information is always key and so I won't make my moves until a Friday afternoon. The exception to this rule is when there are no midweek European fixtures (like before gameweek two) or where you may be priced out of a move you have exact funds for.\\n\\nTrust your gut\\n\\nMAX: Last season I changed the way I play. I didn't have as much time as before to be online and consume FPL content. Everything I did last season was purely gut instinct - I didn't look at any statistics!\\n\\nI was changing my team 30 minutes before the deadline, going for players I really liked and trusting my gut. Even though I'm a maths teacher I stayed away from statistics as you can get bogged down in them and over analyse things.\\n\\nPay attention to minutes, set-pieces and penalty takers\\n\\nPRAS: Sometimes, counter-intuitively, FPL is about picking the reliable players over flair players.\\n\\nAn example I used to use was even though Riyad Mahrez looked amazing on the eye, a player like Bruno Fernandes was always a far superior FPL pick, simply because he was nailed on to play 90 minutes, take free-kicks and penalties.\\n\\nThese points add up and make these picks more fixture-proof since a free-kick goal or penalty is not as dependant on the difficulty of the opponent.\\n\\nWhen stuck between two players, always pick the guy taking penalties or set-pieces.\\n\\nWatch as much Premier League football as you can\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Watch full matches where possible and extended highlights of all the games. Watching more football allows you to spot things you may not notice from stats alone, while it also allows you to interpret data easier as you'll have the required context.\\n\\nMAX: I watched a lot of games last season, so I was seeing players I enjoyed watching and going for them - using the good old eye test.\\n\\nAvoid panic buys and rage sells - back your decisions\\n\\nPRAS: FPL is a game of patience, but football is a very unpredictable sport. This is a recipe for a lot of regret.\\n\\nYou pick Bukayo Saka as your captain and he misses a penalty. This is an example of good decision, bad outcome.\\n\\nManagers must understand there is an element of luck in the game but making good decisions over the long-term generally leads to good outcomes. Trust the process.\\n\\nDon't understimate the importance of xG\\n\\nGIANNI: Some fans are not keen on expected goals (xG) as a metric, but it is important in FPL.\\n\\nIf an attacker is clocking a high xG but not converting that into goals, they're either a bad finisher or more likely, they're close to catching a big haul really soon.\\n\\nMake sure you know the new rules and adjust\\n\\nGIANNI: Goals and assists will always be king but the new defensive contribution points will change how we build our FPL teams moving forward, especially when shopping for budget defenders and midfielders.\\n\\nThe first few weeks could be a learning curve so pay close attention and be ready to react.\\n\\nWhat are FPL's new rules for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n19 hours ago\\n\\nSave money in defence\\n\\nMAX: I never spend a lot of money on defensive options. This year I'm going for two £4.5m defenders and two £4.0m\\n\\nIf they pick up clean sheets then great, and I'm banking on them making up the difference to more expensive picks with the new defensive contribution points.\\n\\nI've never spent much on defence - with the exception of an FPL star such as Trent Alexander-Arnold - and once I've picked my defence I tend to set and forget.\\n\\nAnd finally - stop caring about other people's teams\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Everyone wants to beat their mini-league rivals and finish with as high a rank as possible, but you can get stuck if you pay too much attention to other people's teams.\\n\\nDon't try to be the same as them. Don't try to be different to them.\\n\\nSimply focus on what you can control - your own team - to maximise your points. Your overall rank and mini-leagues will take care of themselves.\\n\\nRelated topics\\n\\nPremier League\\n\\nFootball\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.sportsdunia.com/fantasy-premier-league/how-to-play-fpl-challenge-2025-26', 'query': 'FPL Scout best tips and advice latest', 'category': 'fpl'}, page_content=\"Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHome\\n\\nFantasy Premier League\\n\\nHow to Play FPL Challenge 2025/26\\n\\nFPL Challenge 2025/26: How to Play & Win Prizes\\n\\nAllan Binoy\\n\\nPublished - Aug 01, 2025, 11:35 AM\\n\\n7 min\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHere's all you need to know about the new FPL Challenge\\n\\nRules, regulations, and the prizes to win\\n\\nGet the edge over your competition with this detailed guide\\n\\nIf you’re an FPL (Fantasy Premier League) fanatic, or maybe just looking to spice up your fantasy football journey, the Fantasy Premier League Challenge for the 2025/26 season is about to become your new obsession.

In the Fantasy Premier League challenge, it doesn't matter if you forget to update your team for one week, because you start with a clean slate for every single gameweek.\\n\\nWhat is the FPL Challenge?\\n\\nThe FPL Challenge is a dynamic, fast-paced alternative to the classic Fantasy Premier League. Instead of just setting your team at the start of the season and making tweaks every week, you’re handed the power to build an entirely new squad for each Gameweek, adapting to weekly challenges and unique scoring rules. Think of it as playing a Free Hit chip every week, but with a twist to keep you guessing and strategising all season long. If you've played games like Clash of Clans, think of it as the Clash Royale version of FPL: the same players, mainly the same rules, but just a little bit more casual and fun. Something that everyone can be a part of. The main advantage of the FPL challenge is the fact that you don't get penalised for not taking part in any particular Gameweek. For fans who struggle to update or change their squads every week, this is the perfect opportunity to flex your Premier League knowledge. Add to that the fact that there are prizes to win, sometimes every gameweek, and even at the end of the season.\\n\\nHow FPL Challenge Differs from Regular FPL\\n\\nHow to Play the FPL Challenge\\n\\n1. Sign Up and Set Your Squad\\n\\nHead to fplchallenge.premierleague.com or access via the main FPL site.\\n\\nEach week, you’ll start with a blank team sheet. Your previous week’s choices don’t carry over.\\n\\nPick 15 players (two Goalkeepers, five Defenders, five Midfielders, three Forwards) within your budget, unless the week’s challenge says otherwise.\\n\\nYou can pick up to five players from the same Premier League team.\\n\\nName your captain and vice-captain, just like in classic FPL.\\n\\n2. Adapt to the Weekly Challenge\\n\\nEvery Gameweek, there’s a specific challenge that shapes your squad-building strategy and the scoring system.\\n\\nLimitless Budget: No financial restrictions, pick your dream XI, regardless of price.\\n\\nForwards Focus: All forwards get double points. Stack that front line.\\n\\nTeam-specific Bonuses: Sometimes, players from certain teams (like Man United vs. Liverpool) get double points.\\n\\nFormation or Squad Tweaks: You might need to pick six-a-side teams, use odd formations, or select a certain number of players from a specific position.\\n\\nNew challenges are announced before each round, so always check the details for the latest twist.\\n\\n3. Submit, Edit, and React (Even Mid-Gameweek!)\\n\\nYou can tweak your best FPL team right up until kick-off for each player. If early line-ups are out and one of your picks is suddenly benched, you can swap them for someone yet to play.\\n\\nMissed the first game? No worries. You can enter a team before any of the weekend’s matches that haven’t kicked off yet.\\n\\nCaptain changes are allowed as long as your captain hasn’t played yet.\\n\\n4. Compete for Prizes and Mini-Leagues\\n\\nEvery Gameweek is independent; you can join or take a break and return without penalty.\\n\\nYou can create and join up to 25 private mini-leagues, perfect for friends, workplaces, or communities.\\n\\nCompete for high scores each week instead of a season-long total.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWeekly and Season Prizes\\n\\nIf you love a reward with your bragging rights, the FPL Challenge has you covered:\\n\\nWeekly Prizes: Top scorers each week can pick up cool FPL swag, official goodies, and occasionally more valuable items like tickets or gadgets (prizes can vary, so check each Gameweek’s announcements).\\n\\nSeason Grand Prize: The overall winner receives two hospitality tickets to a Premier League match in the 2026/27 season, plus travel and accommodation.\\n\\nPrizes for runners-up and mini-league winners may also be available.\\n\\nUnder-18s can play but require a guardian’s permission to claim certain prizes.\\n\\nStrategies and Tips for Winning FPL Challenge\\n\\n1. React Late, Don’t Rush\\n\\nWait for team line-ups, injury news, and last-minute updates before finalising your squad. With no cumulative points, there’s no penalty for last-minute reshuffles.\\n\\n2. Embrace the Challenge\\n\\nStructure your team around the week’s twist. For Limitless Budget weeks, stack premiums. For double-points weeks (e.g., Forwards), put your faith in in-form strikers.\\n\\n3. Maximise Club Stacks\\n\\nWith up to 5 players per club, target teams with favourable fixtures. A clean sweep from a dominant team can rocket you up the leaderboard.\\n\\n4. Play Differentials\\n\\nSince many managers will pile into the obvious picks, adding one or two ‘differential’ players, especially with potential for high returns in that week’s challenge, can make all the difference.\\n\\n5. Be Flexible and Adapt\\n\\nMake mid-Gameweek transfers if a picked player gets benched or if a rival team’s line-up surprises you. Use the flexibility to your advantage.\\n\\nDon’t be afraid to sit a week out if it doesn’t suit you; there’s zero penalty, and you can always come back for the next round.\\n\\n6. Track the Challenge Calendar\\n\\nStay ahead by noting future Gameweek challenges (when they’re announced), so you can plan and scout players from upcoming feature clubs or positions.\\n\\n7. Join Mini-Leagues\\n\\nThe fun multiplies when you’re competing against friends, colleagues, and the wider FPL community.\\n\\nSome leagues offer their own prizes or bragging rights, and you can join up to 25 at once.\\n\\nExample: First Three Challenge Weeks (2025/26)\\n\\nGameweek 1: Unlimited Budget—Every manager picks their perfect (and probably premium-heavy) dream team.\\n\\nGameweek 2: Forwards get double points—load up on strikers.\\n\\nGameweek 3: The big rivalry match (e.g., Liverpool vs. Manchester United)—players from those clubs get double points.\\n\\nCommon FPL Challenge Questions\\n\\nIs FPL Challenge Free to Play?\\n\\nAbsolutely. You can play for free and still have a chance to win prizes. Can I compete in both the classic FPL and FPL Challenge?\\n\\nYes. You can play both formats at the same time; they’re completely independent. Is there a season-long overall rank? Nope, every week is a fresh start. There’s no cumulative leaderboard. This makes it perfect for newcomers or anyone who’s missed a few Gameweeks, or users who want a change from the regular FPL routine. What’s the main appeal compared to regular FPL? It’s fast, flexible, and never punishes you for missing a week. Each round is a chance to shoot for the top, no matter where you landed the week before that.\\n\\nWin, Lose, or Just Play for Fun\\n\\nFPL Challenge is all about maximising your weekly score, adapting to new challenges, and making bold tactical calls in a rapidly changing game space. For the casual fan, it’s a chance to jump in and test your wits against the best, and get yourself familiar with how the FPL works, and who knows, maybe you'll be in it for the long haul next season. For the seasoned FPL addict, it’s another layer of excitement, rivalry, and maybe, just maybe, a shot at hospitality tickets to a Premier League match.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAlso Read\\n\\nWho are the Best FPL Budget Midfielders for 2025/26 Season?\\n\\nHere are the best options under £5.5m to use as midfielders in your FPL team this season, budget friendly options that guarantee results.\\n\\n7 min\\n\\n2 Aug\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nConversation\\n\\n(0 Comments)\\n\\nLoading comments...\\n\\nTrending\\n\\nFPL\\n\\n100+ Best FPL Team Names for Fantasy Premier League 2025/26 Season\\n\\n05 August 2025\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nTop FPL Defenders to Pick for Defensive Contribution Points in Gameweek 1\\n\\n04 August 2025\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nHaaland vs Gyokeres: Whom to pick in Your FPL Team?\\n\\n04 August 2025\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nTop 10 Best FPL Defenders to Pick for Gameweek 1\\n\\n04 August 2025\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrending\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nSportsdunia FPL Predicted Lineup for Gameweek 1 in 2025/26 season\\n\\n03 August 2025\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nHow to Play FPL Draft in 2025-26 Season?\\n\\n02 August 2025\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nWho are the Best FPL Budget Midfielders for 2025/26 Season?\\n\\n02 August 2025\\n\\nFPL\\n\\nTop 10 Best Budget FPL Players for 2025/26 Season\\n\\n02 August 2025\\n\\nEdited by- Anurag Mitra\\n\\nFollow Us:\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.premierleague.com/en/news/4364856/everything-you-need-to-pick-your-202526-fantasy-squad', 'query': 'FPL Scout best tips and advice latest', 'category': 'fpl'}, page_content=\"Everything you need to pick your 2025/26 Fantasy squad\\n\\nThe Scout 04 Aug 2025\\n\\nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced manager, find all the essential FPL tips and advice here\\n\\nThe Scout and Fantasy Premier League experts are providing everything you need to pick your 2025/26 squad.

What price structure you go with also has a lot to do with the flexibility of squad as well. Let us break this down with the example of my current premiums.\\n\\nIn my current draft (which is far away from my final one), I have Mohamed Salah (£14.5m), Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) in my team.\\n\\nLet me explain the reasoning behind the same, starting with captaincy.\\n\\nSalah is an opening-day monster who is a good option to cover Gameweeks 1, 4 and 5. His fixtures in Gameweeks 2 and 3 are not the best on paper, which is why it might be helpful to find captaincy options in those Gameweeks.\\n\\nPalmer does a good job of covering Gameweeks 2 and 3. He’s got a decent run of fixtures at the start of the season, which really turns great from Gameweek 9 onwards.\\n\\nWhat stands out in Gameweek 2, though, is that Arsenal face Leeds United at home. If I can help it, I want to have a captaincy option from the Gunners in that week, which is why I’m thinking of including either Gyokeres or Bukayo Saka (£10.0m). Now, Palmer against West Ham United (away) or Salah against Newcastle United (away) are perfectly good captaincy options. That fixture against Leeds just stands out. however.\\n\\nHAALAND’S CASE FOR INCLUSION\\n\\nAlternatively, if you look at Erling Haaland’s (£14.0m) fixtures, he’s a good captaincy option in most weeks except Gameweek 5. There’s certainly a case to make to start the season with him, should you choose to do it.\\n\\nThe real appealing match-up for Haaland, though, is the fixture in Gameweek 6 at home to Burnley. He is definitely the best captaincy option that week. From that point, he’s got a good run of fixtures and it would be very handy to have him from Gameweeks 6 to 10.\\n\\nThis is where the flexibility and team structure come in. By virtue of owning two of the most expensive midfielders in Salah and Palmer, your team automatically becomes a little more flexible. Simply put, if you’re cash isn’t distributed and is instead condensed amongst some of the premiums, it should take fewer moves to get to another heavy hitter. To make it even simpler: it is easier to sell Salah than to buy him.\\n\\nThat is why a punt on Gyokeres (it is very much a punt at this stage) is an idea I am considering right now, so that I have money constricted in my squad in three places. This makes it easier to distribute and buy a certain Norwegian in Gameweek 6 if I choose to go there.\\n\\nGyokeres can very much be Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), too, given his fixtures at the start of the season. We can’t confidently say that Gyokeres is nailed on to start the first two games (as of now), given the presence of Kai Havertz (£7.5m) and the fact that Gyokeres has joined training late. We don’t even know how quickly he’ll bed in with his new teammates.\\n\\nINFORMATION OVERLOAD\\n\\nSpeaking of knowing things, I feel like there is so much information to obtain at the start of the season that it is important to be agile while picking your squad. Think about it: we’ve had more turnover at the top clubs than in any other season in recent memory.\\n\\nLiverpool alone could have two or three new players in their front four and two new players in their back five. We don’t have reliable information yet on who the picks at Manchester City might be outside of Haaland, given the number of options there. We don’t know who is going to be on penalties between Saka or Gyokeres. Spurs have a new manager.\\n\\nThere is simply a lot to learn, especially with little to no pre-season for Manchester City and Chelsea. We don’t quite realise how much information is going to hit us in the first few weeks, which is why being flexible and not being handcuffed is important.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by handcuffs? I refer to the Bench Boost. If I can help it, I really want to utilise my Bench Boost before I use my first Wildcard. If you haven’t already seen Pras’ chip strategy video, I highly recommend it:\\n\\nWHEN TO WILDCARD?\\n\\nGiven the barrage of information that we might receive in the first few weeks, my approach to a Wildcard is to be agile between Gameweeks 6 and 13. Let’s have a quick look at the landscape:\\n\\nArsenal have a great run from Gameweek 7 onwards and Chelsea from Gameweek 9 onwards. While Liverpool and Manchester City have very appealing schedules from Gameweek 13, their matches from Gameweeks 8/6 respectively are not bad at all.\\n\\nGiven the number of expensive assets from these teams that we’ll need together, team value might be very important this season. In addition, to afford more of these players in your team, you will need to make sure you don’t spread your funds and spend them on the pitch.\\n\\nWhile the teams to target on a Gameweek 13 Wildcard will be City and Liverpool, going early on these assets, given their fixtures, won’t be a bad idea.\\n\\nThat is why I have an agile approach to a Wildcard between Gameweeks 6 and 13 based on how confident I am with what I’ve learned in the first few Gameweeks and provided I’ve used my Bench Boost.\\n\\nBENCH BOOST BEFORE WILDCARD\\n\\nIf I’ve used my Bench Boost before my Wildcard (which is what I really want to do), I will be able to go bottom price on my second ‘keeper, fifth defender and eighth attacker, which means I am not spreading my funds and spending them on the pitch instead. That will allow me to get a higher chunk of expensive assets from good teams. I can always spread funds around during AFCON once Salah leaves to help deal with the Christmas rotation.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I am looking at an early Bench Boost. Which week for that chip is something I will explore in a later article.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this one!\\n\\nPosted by lateriser12 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n325 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFodderx4\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nMorning All, how is this looking for now? 442 is currently appealing to me before as can see the premium defenders outscoring midfielders and forwards upto 6m.

I have always placed huge emphasis on getting things pretty right for GW 1 but this year is particularly challenging. The uncertainty (player movement, new to PL, new coaches, players with huge reputations, traps), there is a need to be cautious. I have read a lot of thoughts about BB in GW1 and feel that this may be premature. I will attempt to bank a few transfers and launch BB around weeks 4 or 5. That will then give me some time to reset for a wildcard around 10-13.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAaa\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nWhat to change here?

Not just that but increases the likelihood of an early wildcard, as when you see that extra cash on the bench you\\'ll want to put it on the pitch\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nEarly wildcard of course might be the play though if Isak ends up at Liverpool GW4, etc\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Mal\\n\\n1 Year\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nThere\\'s two sides to that. If you don\\'t play it early, then it could disrupt your planning, at some point you might have to spend a transfer on your 2nd keeper/5th defender/8th attacker instead of focusing on higher upside moves. The main negatives of an early BB are definitely the lack of info and the lower team value. However, starting without Salah and Haaland seems more viable than other years making it easier to spread the funds, but we\\'ll most likely need at least one of them further down the line. Another factor to consider is that saving it for later means you\\'ll play it when teams have a tighter schedule (cups and European competitions) increasing the rotation risk.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nI will probably try to use it straight after wildcarding and use barely any funds to play it.

It isn't about who to pick this week or even next, a good manager looks at blocks of fixtures and targets players with good medium-term fixture runs. Doing so avoids knee-jerking on moves, especially for players that only have one good fixture and then a not-so-great run. Have a plan and stick to it as much as possible.\\n\\nHOLLY: Team form and upcoming fixture ease are two vitally important metrics to consider when making transfers. Keep a close eye on both when planning transfers, in order to pick up key players before their hot streak begins and steal a march on your rivals.\\n\\nBalance premium picks in your week one team\\n\\nHOLLY: It's important to strike the right balance of premium players, particularly at the start of the season when form is more unpredictable.\\n\\nFor greater transfer flexibility, try to pick a premium player in each position in your gameweek one team and then make a captaincy matrix for upcoming weeks to hone in on your key transfer targets.\\n\\nWhat's changed in FPL for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n20 hours ago\\n\\nHow to join BBC Sport's FPL league\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n1 day ago\\n\\nHow to follow FPL on BBC Sport in 2025-26 season\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n1 day ago\\n\\nDon't be stubborn when you've made a mistake\\n\\nHEISENBERG: You have to acknowledge when you've made an error by either bringing a player in you shouldn't have, or by ignoring a player in hot form that needs to come in.\\n\\nIt happens to us all - the key is to rectify these situations as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAvoid hits and early transfers\\n\\nGIANNI: It's better to roll transfers and go weeks without one if you can. Stay patient, use your bench if you need to and accumulate transfers. With several free transfers you can make significant changes to your team structure and make moves for even the most expensive assets without taking hits.\\n\\nHOLLY: I try to avoid early transfers wherever possible - information is always key and so I won't make my moves until a Friday afternoon. The exception to this rule is when there are no midweek European fixtures (like before gameweek two) or where you may be priced out of a move you have exact funds for.\\n\\nTrust your gut\\n\\nMAX: Last season I changed the way I play. I didn't have as much time as before to be online and consume FPL content. Everything I did last season was purely gut instinct - I didn't look at any statistics!\\n\\nI was changing my team 30 minutes before the deadline, going for players I really liked and trusting my gut. Even though I'm a maths teacher I stayed away from statistics as you can get bogged down in them and over analyse things.\\n\\nPay attention to minutes, set-pieces and penalty takers\\n\\nPRAS: Sometimes, counter-intuitively, FPL is about picking the reliable players over flair players.\\n\\nAn example I used to use was even though Riyad Mahrez looked amazing on the eye, a player like Bruno Fernandes was always a far superior FPL pick, simply because he was nailed on to play 90 minutes, take free-kicks and penalties.\\n\\nThese points add up and make these picks more fixture-proof since a free-kick goal or penalty is not as dependant on the difficulty of the opponent.\\n\\nWhen stuck between two players, always pick the guy taking penalties or set-pieces.\\n\\nWatch as much Premier League football as you can\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Watch full matches where possible and extended highlights of all the games. Watching more football allows you to spot things you may not notice from stats alone, while it also allows you to interpret data easier as you'll have the required context.\\n\\nMAX: I watched a lot of games last season, so I was seeing players I enjoyed watching and going for them - using the good old eye test.\\n\\nAvoid panic buys and rage sells - back your decisions\\n\\nPRAS: FPL is a game of patience, but football is a very unpredictable sport. This is a recipe for a lot of regret.\\n\\nYou pick Bukayo Saka as your captain and he misses a penalty. This is an example of good decision, bad outcome.\\n\\nManagers must understand there is an element of luck in the game but making good decisions over the long-term generally leads to good outcomes. Trust the process.\\n\\nDon't understimate the importance of xG\\n\\nGIANNI: Some fans are not keen on expected goals (xG) as a metric, but it is important in FPL.\\n\\nIf an attacker is clocking a high xG but not converting that into goals, they're either a bad finisher or more likely, they're close to catching a big haul really soon.\\n\\nMake sure you know the new rules and adjust\\n\\nGIANNI: Goals and assists will always be king but the new defensive contribution points will change how we build our FPL teams moving forward, especially when shopping for budget defenders and midfielders.\\n\\nThe first few weeks could be a learning curve so pay close attention and be ready to react.\\n\\nWhat are FPL's new rules for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n20 hours ago\\n\\nSave money in defence\\n\\nMAX: I never spend a lot of money on defensive options. This year I'm going for two £4.5m defenders and two £4.0m\\n\\nIf they pick up clean sheets then great, and I'm banking on them making up the difference to more expensive picks with the new defensive contribution points.\\n\\nI've never spent much on defence - with the exception of an FPL star such as Trent Alexander-Arnold - and once I've picked my defence I tend to set and forget.\\n\\nAnd finally - stop caring about other people's teams\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Everyone wants to beat their mini-league rivals and finish with as high a rank as possible, but you can get stuck if you pay too much attention to other people's teams.\\n\\nDon't try to be the same as them. Don't try to be different to them.\\n\\nSimply focus on what you can control - your own team - to maximise your points. Your overall rank and mini-leagues will take care of themselves.\\n\\nRelated topics\\n\\nPremier League\\n\\nFootball\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.premierleague.com/en/news/4364931/fpl-experts-is-it-a-good-idea-to-bench-boost-in-gameweek-1', 'query': 'Fantasy Premier League wildcard and transfer strategy', 'category': 'fpl'}, page_content='FPL experts: Is it a good idea to Bench-Boost in Gameweek 1?\\n\\nEditorial 02 Aug 2025\\n\\nThe Scout\\'s panel of experts discuss whether it is a good idea to play the chip from the outset in 2025/26 Fantasy\\n\\nThis season there will be TWO Bench Boost chips, with the first needing to be played by Gameweek 19. Here, the Scout\\'s panel of Fantasy Premier League experts explain whether they would suggest playing it in the opening week of the season.\\n\\nCreate your squad NOW\\n\\nSam Bonfield (@FPLFamily)\\n\\nI\\'m currently planning to Bench-Boost in Gameweek 1. We often get a good knowledge of who will start in the final pre-season matches so it feels like a good opportunity - especially as then I can remove money from the bench players and invest it in the starting XI much earlier on than if you don\\'t go early with the chip.\\n\\nUtkarsh Dalmia (@ZopharFPL)\\n\\nI think the Bench Boost chip is a bit overrated and often it can cripple your squad in planning for it, because you have to mop up injuries and suspensions in your squad rather than focus on buying emerging players. This is why I like getting it out of the way in Gameweek 1, as you can then focus on your starting XI rather than the fringe players.\\n\\nGianni Buttice (@GianniButtice)\\n\\nI\\'m committed to Bench-Boosting early as I want it out of the way before I Wildcard. But I\\'m still unsure where in the first five Gameweeks I will pull the trigger. The fear with playing my Bench Boost chip in Gameweek 1 is we end up making the best possible squad for one week only and don\\'t put enough focus on the other early weeks which could prove to be better Bench-Boost windows.\\n\\nLee Bonfield (@FPLFamily)\\n\\nI\\'m certainly not against it. It\\'s probably the chip that most influences my thinking as I go through the weeks with it in my back pocket. My transfers tend to be \"squad\\'\\' transfers, perhaps to the detriment of fielding the strongest possible XI. I\\'m not currently planning to use it in Gameweek 1, due to uncertainty of who\\'s going to start, but as pre-season plays out, I could be persuaded!\\n\\nPras (@Pras_FPL)\\n\\nIf I can find a structure that I am happy with and some budget gems emerge such as a £4.0m goalkeeper or £4.0m defender then I am strongly considering playing the Bench Boost in Gameweek 1. My thinking is not necessarily to maximise the points on the bench itself, but for it not to hinder my future transfers where I am focusing on changing my fifth defender (to Bench Boost) when other more exciting moves make more sense.\\n\\nPranil Sheth (@lateriser12)\\n\\nI like the idea of Bench-Boosting before using the Wildcard because there are a lot more premium players in the game now, and I want to spend money on the pitch and not on my bench when I Wildcard for a longer duration - especially with fixtures for Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea looking good from Gameweek 10 onwards.\\n\\nNick Harris (@WGTA_Nick)\\n\\nI am a strong advocate of using my Bench Boost early, possibly Gameweek 1. Then you don\\'t need to worry about maintaining a strong bench going forward and can start disinvesting and moving more of your budget back into your starting XI, either through transfers or an early Wildcard.\\n\\nHolly Shand (@HollyShand)\\n\\nOn paper, Gameweek 1 is one of the best times to play the Bench Boost. It might lead to an early Wildcard but I\\'m open to that anyway. That being said, I haven\\'t currently built a team with a view to Bench-Boosting as I\\'m still waiting for good budget options to emerge and there\\'s high risk pinpointing who will start, with only pre-season form to go on.\\n\\nAndy North (@FPLMode)\\n\\nGameweek 1 is arguably the hardest week to predict which players will play, let alone picking 15. I\\'m happy to wait until Gameweek 16-19 when we will be given five free transfers to help plan around this season’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and use it then.

What price structure you go with also has a lot to do with the flexibility of squad as well. Let us break this down with the example of my current premiums.\\n\\nIn my current draft (which is far away from my final one), I have Mohamed Salah (£14.5m), Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) in my team.\\n\\nLet me explain the reasoning behind the same, starting with captaincy.\\n\\nSalah is an opening-day monster who is a good option to cover Gameweeks 1, 4 and 5. His fixtures in Gameweeks 2 and 3 are not the best on paper, which is why it might be helpful to find captaincy options in those Gameweeks.\\n\\nPalmer does a good job of covering Gameweeks 2 and 3. He’s got a decent run of fixtures at the start of the season, which really turns great from Gameweek 9 onwards.\\n\\nWhat stands out in Gameweek 2, though, is that Arsenal face Leeds United at home. If I can help it, I want to have a captaincy option from the Gunners in that week, which is why I’m thinking of including either Gyokeres or Bukayo Saka (£10.0m). Now, Palmer against West Ham United (away) or Salah against Newcastle United (away) are perfectly good captaincy options. That fixture against Leeds just stands out. however.\\n\\nHAALAND’S CASE FOR INCLUSION\\n\\nAlternatively, if you look at Erling Haaland’s (£14.0m) fixtures, he’s a good captaincy option in most weeks except Gameweek 5. There’s certainly a case to make to start the season with him, should you choose to do it.\\n\\nThe real appealing match-up for Haaland, though, is the fixture in Gameweek 6 at home to Burnley. He is definitely the best captaincy option that week. From that point, he’s got a good run of fixtures and it would be very handy to have him from Gameweeks 6 to 10.\\n\\nThis is where the flexibility and team structure come in. By virtue of owning two of the most expensive midfielders in Salah and Palmer, your team automatically becomes a little more flexible. Simply put, if you’re cash isn’t distributed and is instead condensed amongst some of the premiums, it should take fewer moves to get to another heavy hitter. To make it even simpler: it is easier to sell Salah than to buy him.\\n\\nThat is why a punt on Gyokeres (it is very much a punt at this stage) is an idea I am considering right now, so that I have money constricted in my squad in three places. This makes it easier to distribute and buy a certain Norwegian in Gameweek 6 if I choose to go there.\\n\\nGyokeres can very much be Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), too, given his fixtures at the start of the season. We can’t confidently say that Gyokeres is nailed on to start the first two games (as of now), given the presence of Kai Havertz (£7.5m) and the fact that Gyokeres has joined training late. We don’t even know how quickly he’ll bed in with his new teammates.\\n\\nINFORMATION OVERLOAD\\n\\nSpeaking of knowing things, I feel like there is so much information to obtain at the start of the season that it is important to be agile while picking your squad. Think about it: we’ve had more turnover at the top clubs than in any other season in recent memory.\\n\\nLiverpool alone could have two or three new players in their front four and two new players in their back five. We don’t have reliable information yet on who the picks at Manchester City might be outside of Haaland, given the number of options there. We don’t know who is going to be on penalties between Saka or Gyokeres. Spurs have a new manager.\\n\\nThere is simply a lot to learn, especially with little to no pre-season for Manchester City and Chelsea. We don’t quite realise how much information is going to hit us in the first few weeks, which is why being flexible and not being handcuffed is important.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by handcuffs? I refer to the Bench Boost. If I can help it, I really want to utilise my Bench Boost before I use my first Wildcard. If you haven’t already seen Pras’ chip strategy video, I highly recommend it:\\n\\nWHEN TO WILDCARD?\\n\\nGiven the barrage of information that we might receive in the first few weeks, my approach to a Wildcard is to be agile between Gameweeks 6 and 13. Let’s have a quick look at the landscape:\\n\\nArsenal have a great run from Gameweek 7 onwards and Chelsea from Gameweek 9 onwards. While Liverpool and Manchester City have very appealing schedules from Gameweek 13, their matches from Gameweeks 8/6 respectively are not bad at all.\\n\\nGiven the number of expensive assets from these teams that we’ll need together, team value might be very important this season. In addition, to afford more of these players in your team, you will need to make sure you don’t spread your funds and spend them on the pitch.\\n\\nWhile the teams to target on a Gameweek 13 Wildcard will be City and Liverpool, going early on these assets, given their fixtures, won’t be a bad idea.\\n\\nThat is why I have an agile approach to a Wildcard between Gameweeks 6 and 13 based on how confident I am with what I’ve learned in the first few Gameweeks and provided I’ve used my Bench Boost.\\n\\nBENCH BOOST BEFORE WILDCARD\\n\\nIf I’ve used my Bench Boost before my Wildcard (which is what I really want to do), I will be able to go bottom price on my second ‘keeper, fifth defender and eighth attacker, which means I am not spreading my funds and spending them on the pitch instead. That will allow me to get a higher chunk of expensive assets from good teams. I can always spread funds around during AFCON once Salah leaves to help deal with the Christmas rotation.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I am looking at an early Bench Boost. Which week for that chip is something I will explore in a later article.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed reading this one!\\n\\nPosted by lateriser12 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n325 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nFodderx4\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nMorning All, how is this looking for now? 442 is currently appealing to me before as can see the premium defenders outscoring midfielders and forwards upto 6m.

I have always placed huge emphasis on getting things pretty right for GW 1 but this year is particularly challenging. The uncertainty (player movement, new to PL, new coaches, players with huge reputations, traps), there is a need to be cautious. I have read a lot of thoughts about BB in GW1 and feel that this may be premature. I will attempt to bank a few transfers and launch BB around weeks 4 or 5. That will then give me some time to reset for a wildcard around 10-13.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAaa\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n3 days, 8 hours ago\\n\\nWhat to change here?

Waiting lets you see if there\\'s any good cheapies available. Not just that but increases the likelihood of an early wildcard, as when you see that extra cash on the bench you\\'ll want to put it on the pitch\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nEarly wildcard of course might be the play though if Isak ends up at Liverpool GW4, etc\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Mal\\n\\n1 Year\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nThere\\'s two sides to that. If you don\\'t play it early, then it could disrupt your planning, at some point you might have to spend a transfer on your 2nd keeper/5th defender/8th attacker instead of focusing on higher upside moves. The main negatives of an early BB are definitely the lack of info and the lower team value. However, starting without Salah and Haaland seems more viable than other years making it easier to spread the funds, but we\\'ll most likely need at least one of them further down the line. Another factor to consider is that saving it for later means you\\'ll play it when teams have a tighter schedule (cups and European competitions) increasing the rotation risk.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nQaiss\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n3 days, 7 hours ago\\n\\nI will probably try to use it straight after wildcarding and use barely any funds to play it.

Whether he’s fully up to speed in time for Gameweek 1 remains to be seen, but Gyokeres’s arrival is likely to mean that Kai Havertz (£7.5m) drops back into midfield, despite registering two assists as a striker during a pre-season win over Newcastle United.\\n\\nWilliam Saliba (£6.0m) and Ben White (£5.5m) lead the way for pre-season minutes so far, just ahead of Havertz. New centre-back Cristhian Mosquera (£4.5m) made a brief debut against Spurs but may not see much early-season action, with Gabriel Magalhaes (£6.0m), Riccardo Calafiori (£5.5m) and Jurrien Timber (£5.5m) all now expected to be fit in time for Gameweek 1.\\n\\nEven if Calafiori is fit, Myles Lewis-Skelly (£5.5m) should start the season at left-back, having featured more heavily in pre-season.\\n\\nLeandro Trossard (£7.0m) appeared to pick up a muscular issue against Spurs and needs to be assessed, Arteta said post-match, while Bukayo Saka (£10.0m) also looked to have taken a knock before going off in that game. Saka had previously proved the difference-maker in the Gunners’ opening pre-season win over AC Milan.\\n\\nNew signing Noni Madueke (£7.0m) did not play during Arsenal's pre-season tour of Asia, having been given time off after being at the FIFA Club World Cup with former club Chelsea.\\n\\nAston Villa\\n\\nVilla are yet to keep a pre-season clean sheet in five attempts but their defence showed marked improvement towards the end of last season. England international Ezri Konsa (£4.5m) is proving a popular pick, sitting in just under a quarter of FPL teams, but Tyrone Mings (£4.5m), Pau Torres (£4.5m) and Lucas Digne (£4.5m) have more pre-season minutes under their belts to date.\\n\\nThe versatile Lamare Bogarde (£4.0m) - one of the cheapest defenders available in FPL - has the most minutes of any Villa player so far, including some game-time in central midfield.\\n\\nOllie Watkins (£9.0m) - one of only two players in Europe’s top five leagues to rack up 50+ goals and 25+ assists over the last three seasons - has netted goals in each of his three pre-season outings so far.\\n\\nAnother top performer so far in pre-season is Donyell Malen (£5.5m). The Dutch winger, who is also capable of playing up front, registered one goal and three assists. He could see increased game time this season, now that there is less competition for attacking spots.\\n\\nAFC Bournemouth\\n\\nDorde Petrovic (£4.5m) has emerged as Bournemouth’s likely first-choice goalkeeper following his arrival from Chelsea. After a solid loan spell at Strasbourg last season, the Serbia international has largely been preferred by Andoni Iraola to Neto (£4.5m) during the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.\\n\\nAdrien Truffert (£4.5m) has arrived from Ligue 1’s Rennes and the early evidence from pre-season and his past suggests he'll combine solid defensive work with a penchant for crossing. The left-back also netted a brace in a friendly win over Bristol City, showcasing his ability to score chances as well as create them for others.\\n\\nCheap defender James Hill (£4.0m) has racked up the fifth-most pre-season minutes of any Bournemouth player but may not be a regular starter once the main action commences, unless someone like Illia Zabarnyi (£5.0m) leaves the Vitality Stadium.\\n\\nCentral midfielder Philip Billing (£5.0m) has returned from his six-month loan with Serie A winners Napoli and could be a decent budget option if he can build on his pre-season goals.\\n\\nBrentford\\n\\nThe Bees have only played two official pre-season matches so far, drawing 1-1 with Gil Vicente before beating Queens Park Rangers 1-0.\\n\\nNew goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher (£4.5m) has emerged as one of FPL’s most popular selections in his position and has racked up the most minutes of any Brentford player.\\n\\nBudget defenders Michael Kayode (£4.5m), Rico Henry (£4.5m) and Aaron Hickey (£4.0m) have seen game-time, too. The latter duo performed well on their returns from long-term injuries, meaning the full-back positions are worth monitoring for some potential bargains.\\n\\nUntil Keith Andrews’ first-choice XI takes shape, though, it’s hard to look past centre-back Nathan Collins (£5.0m), who last season delivered nine attacking returns and plenty of defensive contributions. He scored in Friday's win over QPR, indeed.\\n\\nMikkel Damsgaard (£6.0m), who finished 2024/25 with 10 league assists, set up Igor Thiago (£6.0m) in Brentford’s pre-season opener against Gil Vicente. Thiago, who missed most of last season with knee issues, had a few other chances in that match and could be a new source of attacking points with Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) gone.\\n\\nBrighton & Hove Albion\\n\\nBrighton are undefeated in each of their pre-season outings to date.\\n\\nMaxim De Cuyper (£4.5m) may prove to be excellent value for money if the Belgian left-back can emulate his attacking form with previous club Club Brugge. He should be first choice in his position, too, now that Pervis Estupinan has departed, though Ferdi Kadioglu (£4.5m) - back from injury - may provide some competition.\\n\\nElsewhere, Bart Verbruggen (£4.5m) hasn't yet featured in pre-season but is expected to recover from injury in time for Gameweek 1.\\n\\nDanny Welbeck (£6.5m) could be set to lead the line for Brighton. He scored four goals against Wycombe Wanderers, and is now the Seagulls' possible first-choice penalty-taker. However, Georginio Rutter (£6.0m) is back from injury and has featured up front at times while playing the most pre-season minutes in the squad.\\n\\nBurnley\\n\\nHaving scored against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 19 July, midfielder Jacob Bruun Larsen (£5.5m) featured up front in Burnley's defeat to Stoke City on 2 August.\\n\\nNew permanent arrival Marcus Edwards (£5.0m) - formerly of Sporting and Spurs - has netted three pre-season goals, including a penalty. Edwards or Bruun Larsen could be on spot-kick duties this season.\\n\\nAn ever-present last season, Maxime Esteve (£4.0m) is probably the likeliest regular starter of several Burnley defenders available in the cheapest FPL price bracket. Quilindschy Hartman (£4.0m) is one to monitor, however, and already has a pre-season assist to his name.\\n\\nChelsea\\n\\nThe Blues won’t compete in pre-season matches until they face Bayer Leverkusen on 8 August, followed by AC Milan two days later, but we can glean a few things from their performances in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup, and their transfer business this summer.\\n\\nCole Palmer (£10.5m) looked to be back to his brilliant best against Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final. The same may be true of Marc Cucurella (£6.0m), whose attacking threat may make him worth the extra million over otherwise solid defensive colleagues like Levi Colwill (£5.0m).\\n\\nIn midfield, Moises Caicedo (£5.5m) looks likely to benefit from the new defensive contribution points in FPL, and Enzo Fernandez (£6.5m) could be a reliable mid-priced option if he continues in his new attacking role.\\n\\nThere have been plenty of newcomers in Maresca’s forward ranks, including Joao Pedro (£7.5m) and Liam Delap (£6.5m) arriving from Brighton and Ipswich Town, respectively. Joao Pedro started up top in the Club World Cup semis and final, scoring three goals.\\n\\nCrystal Palace\\n\\nJean-Philippe Mateta (£7.5m) now has four pre-season goals, following his brace against Augsburg in Austria on Friday. Eberechi Eze (£7.5m) also scored in that game, having previously grabbed a goal against Crawley Town - from a Mateta assist. Meanwhile, Ismaila Sarr (£6.5m) is available for £1.0m less than that duo in FPL and has two assists so far in pre-season from about 120 minutes of action.\\n\\nDefensive contribution points could enable Maxence Lacroix (£5.0m) - the current pre-season minutes leader - or even Marc Guehi (£4.5m) to more closely rival last season’s star defender-come-winger Daniel Munoz (£5.5m), another player who found the net against Crawley. Meanwhile, there looks to be fierce competition at left wing-back between Tyrick Mitchell (£5.0m) and new signing Borna Sosa (£5.0m). The latter has so far appeared to offer a little more attacking threat, and has also taken his share of corners and some free-kicks in pre-season.\\n\\nEverton\\n\\nThe Toffees have just one win in six pre-season matches.\\n\\nDavid Moyes has brought in Carlos Alcaraz (£5.5m) on a permanent deal and have also replaced the departed Dominic Calvert-Lewin with promising young French striker Thierno Barry (£6.0m), who could vie for starting honours up front ahead of Beto (£5.5m). Barry has yet to start a pre-season game for the Toffees, however.\\n\\nDwight McNeil (£6.0m) is Everton’s leading midfielder for pre-season minutes; the playmaker managed 12 attacking returns from only 15 league starts in his injury-hit 2024/25 campaign.\\n\\nIdrissa Gana Gueye (£5.5m) - another defensive contribution leader from last season - has shown some pre-season threat of his own from midfield, delivering a goal and an assist.\\n\\nFulham\\n\\nThe undeniable star of Fulham's pre-season has been Harry Wilson (£5.5m). Making a strong case for more starts this season, the Welshman has scored five goals - including a penalty, albeit when usual taker Raul Jimenez (£6.5m) was off the pitch - and set up another.\\n\\nOther previous FPL assets of interest like Alex Iwobi (£6.5m) and Ryan Sessegnon (£5.5m) - now an FPL midfielder - have assisted Wilson in those efforts, while Emile Smith Rowe (£6.0m) has three goals of his own.\\n\\nLeeds United\\n\\nDaniel Farke’s men drew against Manchester United in their pre-season opener and have since recorded wins against SC Veri and SC Paderborn. Their most recent match was a draw with Villarreal.\\n\\nThose four games have seen forward Joel Piroe (£5.5m) - the Championship’s leading goalscorer last season, with 19 - net four goals in 194 minutes of action, while new arrival Lukas Nmecha (£5.0m) and midfielder Wilfried Gnonto (£5.5m) have scored two apiece. Based on pre-season, Piroe may be Leeds' new first-choice penalty-taker, having scored one when usual go-to guy Pascal Struijk (£4.5m) was also on the pitch.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Largie Ramazani (£5.0m) has two assists to his name and defender Struijk has one, while Anton Stach (£5.0m) grabbed another on his debut in late July.\\n\\nIn defence, new arrivals Jaka Bijol (£4.0m), Gabriel Gudmundsson (£4.0m) and Sebastiaan Bornauw (£4.0m) are all available at FPL’s lowest price point and have featured to varying degrees in pre-season - Bijol and Gudmundsson heavily, with Bornauw slightly less so to date. Struijk and Joe Rodon (£4.0m), last season’s main centre-half pairing, have also remained in the mix.\\n\\nIllan Meslier (£4.5m) and Karl Darlow (£4.0m) have shared goalkeeping duties so far in pre-season, but newcomer Lucas Perri (£4.5m) looks like he’ll be Farke’s new first choice between the posts once he settles in.\\n\\nLiverpool\\n\\nThe Reds reportedly broke their club transfer record to bring in attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz (£8.5m), who has a goal plus two assists in pre-season. They also freshened up at full-back with the signings of two very attack-minded defenders in Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m) and Milos Kerkez (£6.0m), each of whom have been heavily involved in pre-season - although they may still have Conor Bradley (£5.0m) and Andrew Robertson (£6.0m) to contend with.\\n\\nNew forward Hugo Ekitike (£8.5m) was given his first run-out in a win over Yokohama F Marinos on 30 July. He then produced his first assist for Liverpool against Athletic Club. Dominik Szoboszlai (£6.5m) has registered a handful of attacking returns in pre-season, whilst Darwin Nunez (£6.5m) also managed a hat-trick against Stoke City but may still struggle to get minutes when the season starts.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Cody Gakpo (£7.5m) has now returned four goals and an assist in pre-season after scoring twice against Athletic Club. Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) also scored against the Spanish side, but missed a penalty.\\n\\nManchester City\\n\\nManchester City have had one behind-closed-doors friendly against Preston North End, with little known bar the goalscorer, Rico Lewis (£5.0m).\\n\\nCity are yet to engage in much pre-season action due to a break following their participation in the Club World Cup.\\n\\nErling Haaland (£14.0m) scored three times in that tournament, while Jeremy Doku (£6.5m), Ilkay Gundogan (£6.5m) and Phil Foden (£8.0m) netted two goals each.\\n\\nSavinho (£7.0m), Bernardo Silva (£6.5m), Oscar Bobb (£5.5m) and new signing Rayan Cherki (£6.5m) all scored once in the Club World Cup.\\n\\nManchester United\\n\\nThe Red Devils have been undefeated in pre-season, despite facing Premier League teams in all four fixtures.\\n\\nBruno Fernandes (£9.0m) has three goals and one assist to his name, including two penalties - suggesting he remains on spot-kicks despite the arrival of new signings Matheus Cunha (£8.0m) and Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m).\\n\\nFernandes could line up deeper in central midfield as the season goes on, which might hinder his goal contributions from open play, but he featured in the front three with Cunha and Mbeumo in the 2-2 draw with Everton.\\n\\nOne emerging star in pre-season is left wing-back Patrick Dorgu (£4.5m), who excelled in his side’s win against Bournemouth with a goal, assist and clean sheet.\\n\\nBudget enabler Ayden Heaven (£4.0m), meanwhile, has gained some more minutes at centre-back, as he did in Gameweek 38 last season. But with plenty of other central defensive options at Amorim’s disposal, including Luke Shaw (£4.5m) - who has started there on three occasions in pre-season - it may be worth seeing if that situation becomes any clearer prior to the Gameweek 1 deadline.\\n\\nThe same goes for the goalkeepers, with Tom Heaton (£4.0m) potentially vying for a start ahead of Altay Bayindir (£5.0m) if Andre Onana (£5.0m) fails to recover from a hamstring injury in time.\\n\\nNewcastle United\\n\\nAlexander Isak (£10.5m) is yet to feature in pre-season, with William Osula (£5.5m) and Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) deputising in attack so far.\\n\\nAs for the defence, Lewis Hall (£5.5m) made a substitute appearance in Newcastle’s most recent pre-season outing but faces a race against time to be fully fit for the start of the season. If Hall is unavailable, Kieran Trippier (£5.0m) could continue alongside Tino Livramento (£5.0m) as Howe’s full-back pairing. That duo stepped up last season after Hall’s injury.\\n\\nNewcastle beat Carlisle United before losing three straight matches to Celtic, Arsenal and a select XI from the Korean top flight. The run of defeats ended with a draw against Tottenham Hotspur.\\n\\nAnthony Elanga (£7.0m), one of two arrivals at St James’ Park, scored against the Gunners, but so did positional rival Jacob Murphy (£6.5m), who also managed a goal and assist against Carlisle. The two right-wingers may well share minutes, potentially making both players no-go’s in FPL for now.\\n\\nNottingham Forest\\n\\nA lack of goals has been Forest’s glaring issue in pre-season, with Nuno Espirito Santo's side scoring just once in five friendlies. That successful effort - which was only a consolation goal in a loss to Fulham - came from Chris Wood (£7.5m), courtesy of a Neco Williams (£5.0m) assist.\\n\\nNew signing Igor Jesus (£6.0m), formerly of Botafogo, might help take some of the attacking burden off of Wood’s shoulders.\\n\\nNuno can at least take solace in the fact that his side have kept three clean sheets in five attempts, with last season’s backline of Williams, Ola Aina (£5.0m), Nikola Milenkovic (£5.5m) and Murillo (£5.5m) looking to continue their defensive solidity in front of shot-stopper Matz Sels (£5.5m).\\n\\nSunderland\\n\\nThe Black Cats have been mightily busy in the transfer market but now haven’t won in five friendlies since a pre-season opening victory over National League North side South Shields.\\n\\nStill, midfield star Enzo Le Fee (£5.0m) has continued to impress - including from set-pieces - since making his transfer from Roma permanent, and there’s excitement around Simon Adingra (£5.5m) following his move from Brighton. The Ivory Coast international scored in Sunderland’s loss to Hull City, assisted by fellow new winger Chemsdine Talbi (£5.0m).\\n\\nThere’s also Habib Diarra (£5.5m), a Jobe Bellingham replacement who may have a shot at penalty-taking duties given his record for Strasbourg last season.\\n\\nSimon Moore (£4.0m) has been the club’s leading goalkeeper for pre-season minutes so far but looks likely to be usurped in goal by new arrival Robin Roefs (£4.5m).\\n\\nTottenham Hotspur\\n\\nSpurs are unbeaten in five pre-season matches under new boss Thomas Frank, including a win in the first north London derby on foreign soil.\\n\\nThat victory over Arsenal at the end of July came thanks to a Pape Matar Sarr (£5.0m) goal, his third in the space of two matches. The Senegalese midfielder took up some advanced positions against the Gunners and, if he can continue to combine attacking returns with defensive contributions, could emerge as a cheap hidden gem in FPL. An injury to James Maddison (£7.0m) may help his cause.\\n\\nCurrently more popular among FPL managers, though, is new signing Mohammed Kudus (£6.5m), who has also impressed in pre-season so far and appears poised to rival Brennan Johnson (£7.0m) and potential penalty-taking frontman Dominic Solanke (£7.5m) as Spurs’ best attacking option.\\n\\nWest Ham United\\n\\nLucas Paqueta (£6.0m), Niclas Fullkrug (£6.0m) and Jarrod Bowen (£8.0m) have each tallied two goals so far in pre-season. If Fullkrug can stay injury-free and nail down a spot in Graham Potter’s XI, he could offer a strong budget-friendly alternative to the positionally reclassified Bowen.\\n\\nThen there’s James Ward-Prowse (£6.0m), who may also present an intriguing option if he picks up some of the team’s playmaking burden with Kudus gone. Like Fullkrug, he’s been involved in each of his side’s four pre-season matches so far, and is West Ham's top midfielder for minutes.\\n\\nRight wing-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£4.5m) is a popular pick in FPL, and on the opposite flank, new signing El Hadji Malick Diouf (£4.5m) has also had a promising start to life as a Hammer. A capable crosser of the ball while being unafraid to go for goal himself, the quick 20-year-old delivered an assist in the win over Bournemouth.\\n\\nWolverhampton Wanderers\\n\\nThere is expectation at Molineux that incoming playmaker Jhon Arias (£5.5m) can help boost Wolves’ creativity following the loss of key man Cunha, with the Colombian on the scoresheet on his debut against Girona.\\n\\nFollowing the departure of club captain Nelson Semedo, we’ve seen Ki-Jana Hoever (£4.0m) start several consecutive pre-season outings at right wing-back. The Dutchman grabbed an assist for Jorgen Strand Larsen (£6.5m) in one of those matches, and could be a cheap enabler if he keeps his spot.\\n\\nThe same goes for Hugo Bueno or Rodrigo Gomes (both £4.5m) if either player continues to start at left wing-back, although positional rival David Moller Wolfe has now arrived.\\n\\nFeatured\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.premierleague.com/en/news/4364634/why-you-should-pick-salah-and-not-haaland-in-202526-fantasy', 'query': 'Fantasy Premier League best transfers this week', 'category': 'fpl'}, page_content=\"Why you should pick Salah and NOT Haaland in 2025/26 Fantasy\\n\\nThe Scout 01 Aug 2025\\n\\nThe Scout offers advice on managing your budget as the kick-off draws ever closer\\n\\nThe Scout assesses the two most-expensive players in 2025/26 Fantasy Premier League and offers advice.\\n\\nWhen assessing the prospects of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) and Manchester City’s Erling Haaland (£14.0m), Salah’s ownership and captaincy potential is a huge factor and should not be overlooked.\\n\\nOver the last few days, Salah has become the most-selected player in Fantasy, found in over 55 per cent of squads. Haaland, by contrast, is owned by only 18 per cent of managers.\\n\\nCreate your squad NOW\\n\\nThis means that Salah is near-certain to be the most-popular captain in the opening few Gameweeks of the season.\\n\\nIf you go without Salah and he delivers a huge haul at home against AFC Bournemouth in Gameweek 1, the impact would be far more detrimental to your overall rank than if the same thing happened with Haaland.\\n\\nIt is, quite simply, an unnecessary risk to take at the very start of the season.\\n\\nOf course, you could choose to own Salah AND Haaland. Indeed, the article below contains a squad that shows how you can afford them both. But it also underlines the fact that spending £28.5m on only two players forces you to make significant sacrifices across the rest of your squad.\\n\\nHere below are two examples of squads that you could pick if you go WITHOUT Haaland.\\n\\n1) Spend big in attack\\n\\nBy foregoing Haaland and spending big in attack, you could have Chelsea’s Cole Palmer (£10.5m), Arsenal’s Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) and Salah’s new team-mate at Liverpool, Florian Wirtz (£8.5m).\\n\\nPalmer and Wirtz are also among the three most-owned midfielders, alongside Salah, picked by more than 51 and 35 per cent respectively.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gyokeres has quickly become the third most-popular forward, with 23 per cent ownership.\\n\\nCrucially, Palmer is a great captain alternative to Salah, with Chelsea avoiding ALL of last season’s top eight teams in the first six Gameweeks.\\n\\nSee the Fixture Difficulty Ratings for every club\\n\\nIf you go without Haaland you could also pick Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye (£6.5m), who has great opening fixtures too.\\n\\nLike Salah and Palmer, Ndiaye takes penalties for his club - and Gyokeres, Tottenham Hotspur’s Dominic Solanke (£7.5m) and Brighton & Hove Albion’s Danny Welbeck (£6.5m) could also emerge as their club’s new penalty-takers this season.\\n\\nIf you're spending so much of your budget in attack, you'll need to identify budget-friendly players with very favourable early runs of opponents.\\n\\nAt £4.5m, Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, Spurs centre-back Micky van de Ven and West Ham United full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka can offer excellent value over many Gameweeks.\\n\\nThis leaves Nottingham Forest’s Nikola Milenkovic (£5.5m) as the only non-budget defender in the suggested squad below. The centre-back would have placed first for points among defenders in Fantasy last season if the new defensive contribution points had been added.\\n\\n2) Get a balanced squad\\n\\nAlternatively, you could reinvest the Haaland funds across your entire squad and strengthen every area, reducing your reliance on the performance of cheap players.\\n\\nIn contrast to the squad suggested above, this second squad has two premium defenders - Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk (£6.0m) and Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly (£5.5m). You could then rotate Wan-Bissaka and Van de Ven in the third spot, picking whichever player has the better fixture in a given Gameweek.\\n\\nGoalkeeper Matz Sels (£5.0m) offers a cheaper route into Nottingham Forest’s rearguard than Milenkovic ahead of the club's favourable run of opponents.\\n\\nAccording to the Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR), where the difficulty of each fixture is ranked from one to five, with one being the easiest possible match and five being the hardest, Forest’s average of 2.67 over the first six Gameweeks is the joint-best of any side.\\n\\nSee who has the best and worst early fixtures\\n\\nIn midfield, Salah and Palmer are the premium players in this squad, with Ndiaye joined by Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers (£7.0m), who is £2.0m less expensive than Villa forward Ollie Watkins (£9.0m).\\n\\nAlongside Solanke up front, you could have West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen (£8.0m) and Forest’s Chris Wood (£7.5m). Both were ranked among the six top-scoring players in 2024/25 yet they only cost a combined £15.5m, just £1.5m more expensive than Haaland costs by himself.\\n\\nSimilarly to Solanke, they can offer fine value from the outset thanks to their kind early schedules.\\n\\nSee FPL experts' squads\\n\\nFeatured\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2025/08/02/lateriser-on-premium-picks-captaincy-wildcard-bench-boost?hc_page=1&hc_sort_by=comment_date', 'query': 'FPL captain picks latest expert analysis', 'category': 'fpl'}, page_content=\"How to win at FPL - our experts give their best tips\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n5 August 2025, 06:21 BST\\n\\nThe Fantasy Premier League season is just around the corner and, with more managers taking part, achieving that elusive top-10k finish is proving harder than ever.\\n\\nThat's where BBC Sport's four FPL experts for 2025-26 can help.\\n\\nWe've compiled the best advice from Pras, Holly Shand, FPL Heisenberg and Gianni Buttice to help you get ahead of the game.\\n\\nAnd we've also spoken to Max Littleproud, winner of the BBC Sport FPL league last season with an incredible finish of fifth in the world.\\n\\nMax's approach to the game was a little different last season - if xG and underlying data leaves you cold then you might prefer his advice.\\n\\nYou can join the BBC Sport League on the official Fantasy Premier League game using the code bbcfpl - or by clicking this link, external.\\n\\nPrioritise long-term planning over short-term point chasing\\n\\nPRAS: A good FPL manager plays the game like chess. It isn't about who to pick this week or even next, a good manager looks at blocks of fixtures and targets players with good medium-term fixture runs. Doing so avoids knee-jerking on moves, especially for players that only have one good fixture and then a not-so-great run. Have a plan and stick to it as much as possible.\\n\\nHOLLY: Team form and upcoming fixture ease are two vitally important metrics to consider when making transfers. Keep a close eye on both when planning transfers, in order to pick up key players before their hot streak begins and steal a march on your rivals.\\n\\nBalance premium picks in your week one team\\n\\nHOLLY: It's important to strike the right balance of premium players, particularly at the start of the season when form is more unpredictable.\\n\\nFor greater transfer flexibility, try to pick a premium player in each position in your gameweek one team and then make a captaincy matrix for upcoming weeks to hone in on your key transfer targets.\\n\\nWhat's changed in FPL for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n20 hours ago\\n\\nHow to join BBC Sport's FPL league\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n1 day ago\\n\\nHow to follow FPL on BBC Sport in 2025-26 season\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n1 day ago\\n\\nDon't be stubborn when you've made a mistake\\n\\nHEISENBERG: You have to acknowledge when you've made an error by either bringing a player in you shouldn't have, or by ignoring a player in hot form that needs to come in.\\n\\nIt happens to us all - the key is to rectify these situations as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAvoid hits and early transfers\\n\\nGIANNI: It's better to roll transfers and go weeks without one if you can. Stay patient, use your bench if you need to and accumulate transfers. With several free transfers you can make significant changes to your team structure and make moves for even the most expensive assets without taking hits.\\n\\nHOLLY: I try to avoid early transfers wherever possible - information is always key and so I won't make my moves until a Friday afternoon. The exception to this rule is when there are no midweek European fixtures (like before gameweek two) or where you may be priced out of a move you have exact funds for.\\n\\nTrust your gut\\n\\nMAX: Last season I changed the way I play. I didn't have as much time as before to be online and consume FPL content. Everything I did last season was purely gut instinct - I didn't look at any statistics!\\n\\nI was changing my team 30 minutes before the deadline, going for players I really liked and trusting my gut. Even though I'm a maths teacher I stayed away from statistics as you can get bogged down in them and over analyse things.\\n\\nPay attention to minutes, set-pieces and penalty takers\\n\\nPRAS: Sometimes, counter-intuitively, FPL is about picking the reliable players over flair players.\\n\\nAn example I used to use was even though Riyad Mahrez looked amazing on the eye, a player like Bruno Fernandes was always a far superior FPL pick, simply because he was nailed on to play 90 minutes, take free-kicks and penalties.\\n\\nThese points add up and make these picks more fixture-proof since a free-kick goal or penalty is not as dependant on the difficulty of the opponent.\\n\\nWhen stuck between two players, always pick the guy taking penalties or set-pieces.\\n\\nWatch as much Premier League football as you can\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Watch full matches where possible and extended highlights of all the games. Watching more football allows you to spot things you may not notice from stats alone, while it also allows you to interpret data easier as you'll have the required context.\\n\\nMAX: I watched a lot of games last season, so I was seeing players I enjoyed watching and going for them - using the good old eye test.\\n\\nAvoid panic buys and rage sells - back your decisions\\n\\nPRAS: FPL is a game of patience, but football is a very unpredictable sport. This is a recipe for a lot of regret.\\n\\nYou pick Bukayo Saka as your captain and he misses a penalty. This is an example of good decision, bad outcome.\\n\\nManagers must understand there is an element of luck in the game but making good decisions over the long-term generally leads to good outcomes. Trust the process.\\n\\nDon't understimate the importance of xG\\n\\nGIANNI: Some fans are not keen on expected goals (xG) as a metric, but it is important in FPL.\\n\\nIf an attacker is clocking a high xG but not converting that into goals, they're either a bad finisher or more likely, they're close to catching a big haul really soon.\\n\\nMake sure you know the new rules and adjust\\n\\nGIANNI: Goals and assists will always be king but the new defensive contribution points will change how we build our FPL teams moving forward, especially when shopping for budget defenders and midfielders.\\n\\nThe first few weeks could be a learning curve so pay close attention and be ready to react.\\n\\nWhat are FPL's new rules for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n20 hours ago\\n\\nSave money in defence\\n\\nMAX: I never spend a lot of money on defensive options. This year I'm going for two £4.5m defenders and two £4.0m\\n\\nIf they pick up clean sheets then great, and I'm banking on them making up the difference to more expensive picks with the new defensive contribution points.\\n\\nI've never spent much on defence - with the exception of an FPL star such as Trent Alexander-Arnold - and once I've picked my defence I tend to set and forget.\\n\\nAnd finally - stop caring about other people's teams\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Everyone wants to beat their mini-league rivals and finish with as high a rank as possible, but you can get stuck if you pay too much attention to other people's teams.\\n\\nDon't try to be the same as them. Don't try to be different to them.\\n\\nSimply focus on what you can control - your own team - to maximise your points. Your overall rank and mini-leagues will take care of themselves.\\n\\nRelated topics\\n\\nPremier League\\n\\nFootball\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy0pkeyzwgo', 'query': 'FPL captain picks latest expert analysis', 'category': 'fpl'}, page_content=\"FPL expert’s squad: 'Kudus' flexibility offers him security of starts'\\n\\nEditorial 30 Jul 2025\\n\\nFantasy Premier League\\n\\nOne of the world's top Fantasy managers, Lee Bonfield, shares his current FPL team selection\\n\\nWith the 2025/26 Fantasy Premier League season only days away, FPL expert Lee Bonfield has revealed his current 15-man squad and explained his choices. Lee isn't currently planning to use a chip in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nCreate your own squad NOW\\n\\nGoalkeeper\\n\\nCaoimhin Kelleher (£4.5m): As a Liverpool fan I know first hand just how good the new Brentford goalkeeper is. He is well priced and plays for a team who, if they maintain the same style of play as under Thomas Frank, will invite a lot of shots. This could lead to additional points, with every three saves worth an additional point.\\n\\nDefenders\\n\\nVirgin van Dijk (£6.0m): A certain starter in a Liverpool side, who kept the most clean sheets in the league last season. With this and the additional defensive contribution points, Van Dijk should be a points magnet this season.\\n\\nSee: What are defensive contribution points?\\n\\nMurillo (£5.5m): As with Van Dijk, Murillo would have been an excellent asset for defensive contribution points last season. Had the points been in the game last campaign, Murillo would have registered an additional 38 points, only two defenders in the game would have returned more.\\n\\nAaron Wan-Bissaka (£4.5m): West Ham United kept seven clean sheets last season, Wan-Bissaka also added eight attacking returns last time out. He would also have picked up a further 12 points for defensive contributions, so at £4.5m gives good value for money.\\n\\nMidfielders\\n\\nMohamed Salah (£14.5m): The Egyptian king is a no-brainer. Even as the most expensive player in the game, he still feels like a must-have on the back of a record-breaking season in 2024/25.\\n\\nCole Palmer (£10.5m): Having someone in the premium bracket offers really good flexibility. I am at this stage unsure on Palmer v Bukayo Saka (£10.0m), however I do prefer the fixtures for Chelsea to start the season, with NONE of Chelsea’s fist six matches score more than three according to the Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR).\\n\\nChelsea's first six fixtures 25/26\\n\\nGW Opp. FDR 1 Crystal Palace (H) 3 2 West Ham United (A) 2 3 Fulham (H) 3 4 Brentford (A) 3 5 Man Utd (A) 3 6 Brighton (H) 3\\n\\n1=easiest possible fixture, 5=hardest possible fixture\\n\\nFlorian Wirtz (£8.5m): What an exciting signing for Liverpool. Wirtz played 31 matches in the Bundesliga last season scoring 10 goals and registering 12 assists. His pace will see him fit in perfectly to Arne Slot's style of play.\\n\\nMohammed Kudus (£6.5m): Tottenham Hotspur's new signing has played on both the right and the left in the pre-season matches for his new team. This flexibility is a good thing in terms of security of starts. At £6.5m he is potentially a cheap route into the Spurs attack ahead of an opening-weekend fixture at home to Burnley.\\n\\nForwards\\n\\nOllie Watkins (£9.0m): He has started pre-season well and has an important price point. Having the opportunity to move to other premium assets such as Alexander Isak (£10.5m) or Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) depending on how pre-season pans out and if I decide to own Saka.\\n\\nJoao Pedro (£7.5m): With three goals at the FIFA Club World Cup, I am not surprised to see Joao Pedro as the most-owned player in FPL. I am not certain that he will stay in my team, especially as of his 10 goals last season five were penalties and he is unlikely to be on those with Palmer on the pitch.\\n\\nBeto (£5.5m): Everton have signed Thierno Barry (£6.0m) so it remains to be seen if Beto or Barry will lead the line, or indeed play upfront together. Pre-season will be important for whether Beto stays in my team heading into Gameweek 1. I do like Everton's fixtures though, which is why Beto has made my opening squad.\\n\\nBench\\n\\nKarl Darlow (£4.0m): With Leeds United in the market for a new goalkeeper, I am not expecting Darlow to start between the sticks. So if I do decide to play my Bench Boost chip, then I will likely need to find £0.5m to afford a starting goalkeeper.\\n\\nEzri Konsa (£4.5m): Konsa scored two goals in his 32 starts last season as well as keeping eight clean sheets. The defender had 11 attempts from set-pieces, more than any other Aston Villa player. Villa also have a great run of fixtures to start the season.\\n\\nEnzo Le Fee (£5.0m): Le Fee joined Sunderland in January, registering a goal and three assists in 18 starts for the club. Now that he has made his move permanent, he will be a regular starter for Sunderland and at £5.0m he fills that cheap fifth midfielder slot nicely.\\n\\nAlex Moreno (£4.0m): At Villa, Moreno is unlikely to be a regular starter, however if he gets a loan move he could be a great option. If he doesn't I will move to one of the playing £4.0m assets or I'll try and find an extra £0.5m for someone like Micky van de Ven (£4.5m) instead.\\n\\nAlso in this series\\n\\nFeatured\")]"

      "\n",
      "Best budget FPL goalkeepers\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of your goalkeeper will likely be influenced by when you plan or at least expect to Wildcard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gameweek 4 will be a popular window, as it follows an international break. The summer transfer window will have just closed, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gameweek 7 is also attractive, as Fantasy managers can look to capitalise on Arsenal’s favourable fixture swing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this applies to you, there is no need to look too far ahead with the fixtures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is our Season Ticker for the eight clubs featured in the above table, sorted by fixture difficulty in Gameweeks 1-6:\n",
      "\n",
      "Brentford’s Caoimhin Kelleher instantly jumps out. He’s currently the most-owned goalkeeper in FPL, sitting in 32.0% of embryonic squads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bees had to wait until Gameweek 12 of the 2024/25 season to achieve their first clean sheet; however, from that point onwards, they managed to secure eight shut-outs in 27 matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous Brentford shot-stopper Mark Flekken had plenty of other routes to points. He racked up 156 saves in total, 30 more than the next-best goalkeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, this was linked to Thomas Frank’s approach, which limited opponents to low-quality shooting opportunities, frequently from afar. He has since left, along with Christian Norgaard (£5.5m) and Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m), so there are lots of uncertainties regarding Brentford right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brentford’s first six home fixtures are incredibly tough, too (AVL/CHE/MUN/MCI/LIV/NEW), but the £4.5 goalkeeper bracket doesn’t appear to be particularly strong this season, so Kelleher still looks like one of the best options on paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Ham United’s Alphonse Areola is a viable alternative. The Hammers managed only three clean sheets in 18 matches under Graham Potter last season, but their fixtures in Gameweeks 1-6 – including Sunderland (a), Crystal Palace (h) and Everton (a) – are rated as the fourth-best from a defensive perspective on our Season Ticker.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those looking longer-term, Djordje Petrovic, Jose Sa and Bart Verbruggen carry more appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of Kepa Arrizabalaga (£4.5m), Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) will have many Fantasy managers concerned about Bournemouth’s clean sheet potential, but Petrovic excelled on loan at RC Strasbourg last season, where he kept 10 clean sheets in 31 league appearances en route to winning the club’s player of the season award.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial Bournemouth fixtures present challenges, but there are at least a couple of matches that offer shut-out potential before the end of September, namely Wolverhampton Wanderers (h) and Leeds United (a).\n",
      "\n",
      "After a tough start, Sa and Wolves face all three newly-promoted clubs in Gameweeks 5-9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gameweeks 10-17 is probably the best period for Verbruggen and Brighton. The Dutch goalkeeper has yet to feature in pre-season but was pictured at the Spain training camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the newly-promoted options, Leeds United’s Lucas Perri is arguably the best bet, particularly given the current uncertainty surrounding Burnley and Sunderland’s starting goalkeepers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Farke’s side impressed defensively last season, with a total of 25 clean sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Premier League is a completely different proposition, mind, and there are cheaper £4.0m routes into the Whites’ defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "READ MORE: FPL promoted teams: Six-goal Bogle the stand-out Leeds defender\n",
      "\n",
      "Assessing the £4.0m goalkeepers\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a whopping 39 goalkeepers listed at £4.0m, as detailed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s unlikely any of them will be a Gameweek 1 starter without an injury or two to a team-mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation at Tottenham is worth monitoring in pre-season. Guglielmo Vicario (£5.0m) will likely continue as the club’s number one, but Antonin Kinsky’s ability on the ball could make him a decent fit for Frank’s approach. Some have even suggested Kinsky might get the nod in goal, though recent reports have linked him with a loan move to Lille.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karl Darlow’s (£4.0m) stock has fallen following the arrival of Perri, but he could still provide backup with Illan Meslier (£4.5m) potentially on his way out of the club.\n",
      "\n",
      "The back-up custodians of Crystal Palace (Walter Benitez), Fulham (Benjamin Lecomte) and Nottingham Forest (Carlos Miguel) are all listed at £4.0m.\n",
      "\n",

It's easy to say in one sentence that none of them look like starting, but so much detail and research is required to determine which one out of 39 has the best chance of getting game time. All it takes is for a first choice keeper to lose a bit of form and then you have a starting £4m keeper. If you put the work in, you can get ahead of the curve and already have this keeper in your team because you know which starting keeper is most susceptible to being dropped.\n",

      "Bowen's an interesting one This time last season the debate was raging regarding Havertz. I maintained that apart from Firmino 17-18 and mids re-classified as forwards simply doesn't work. Remember that season when Zaha was classified as one as well?! Anyhow, Havertz actually started well and I was reminded of Antonio (with Behnrama 21-22 start). Two things then happened. Havertz did what all POOs do and faded but the biggest development imo was the notice in how the bonus changed and its that latter factor, which for all the negativity I/we have against POOs that means that Bowen may actually prove to be a decent pick...\n",

      "That's where BBC Sport's four FPL experts for 2025-26 can help.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've compiled the best advice from Pras, Holly Shand, FPL Heisenberg and Gianni Buttice to help you get ahead of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we've also spoken to Max Littleproud, winner of the BBC Sport FPL league last season with an incredible finish of fifth in the world.\n",

      "Max's approach to the game was a little different last season - if xG and underlying data leaves you cold then you might prefer his advice.\n",

      "\n",
      "PRAS: A good FPL manager plays the game like chess. It isn't about who to pick this week or even next, a good manager looks at blocks of fixtures and targets players with good medium-term fixture runs. Doing so avoids knee-jerking on moves, especially for players that only have one good fixture and then a not-so-great run. Have a plan and stick to it as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOLLY: Team form and upcoming fixture ease are two vitally important metrics to consider when making transfers. Keep a close eye on both when planning transfers, in order to pick up key players before their hot streak begins and steal a march on your rivals.\n",

      "Balance premium picks in your week one team\n",

      "HOLLY: It's important to strike the right balance of premium players, particularly at the start of the season when form is more unpredictable.\n",

      "GIANNI: It's better to roll transfers and go weeks without one if you can. Stay patient, use your bench if you need to and accumulate transfers. With several free transfers you can make significant changes to your team structure and make moves for even the most expensive assets without taking hits.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOLLY: I try to avoid early transfers wherever possible - information is always key and so I won't make my moves until a Friday afternoon. The exception to this rule is when there are no midweek European fixtures (like before gameweek two) or where you may be priced out of a move you have exact funds for.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was changing my team 30 minutes before the deadline, going for players I really liked and trusting my gut. Even though I'm a maths teacher I stayed away from statistics as you can get bogged down in them and over analyse things.\n",

      "Pay attention to minutes, set-pieces and penalty takers\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "An example I used to use was even though Riyad Mahrez looked amazing on the eye, a player like Bruno Fernandes was always a far superior FPL pick, simply because he was nailed on to play 90 minutes, take free-kicks and penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "These points add up and make these picks more fixture-proof since a free-kick goal or penalty is not as dependant on the difficulty of the opponent.\n",
