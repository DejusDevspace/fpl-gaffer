He was reportedly still in Hawaii on July 31!\\n\\nWe might be looking at a little while (potentially after the September international break?) in terms of starting contention, then, if he requires time to build up his match fitness.\\n\\nGuiu was followed into the club by Arthur Masuaku at the weekend, and Le Bris discussed the pair with reporters.\\n\\n“We are still in the process to improve the squad and progressively new signings like these two will help the squad, even if they started later. So, we’ll have to be patient with them, to build their foundations for the season.” – Regis Le Bris on Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku, to in-house club media\\n\\n“We’ll see. Every day, we will make an assessment of their level and see how far we can push them through the training sessions. Lift the intensity, the contact. If they react well, they can then join the squad. If they don’t react well, we wait one day, two days, and assess again. So we will see for next week.” – Regis Le Bris on whether Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku will be fit for Gameweek 1, via the Northern Echo\\n\\nANOTHER MISSED SUNDERLAND PENALTY!\\n\\nAfter Sunderland failed to score with four of their five penalties last season, a new taker was given the chance against Augsburg – and missed.\\n\\nEliezer Mayenda (£5.5m) took this latest effort, skying it over the bar.\\n\\nThat’s a blow for the budget striker’s FPL appeal, who has the chance to further his claim up front while Guiu is getting up to speed. Another positional rival, Wilson Isidor (£5.5m), is just back from injury,\\n\\nWill he get another chance from 12 yards or will someone like Habib Diarra (£5.5m), who took penalties for Strasbourg last season, get an opportunity? We shall see.\\n\\nMayenda has not had the best pre-season in front of goal in general. On Saturday again, it was everything but the goal. Lots of good movement but wasteful finishing, including two clear-cut chances aside from the spot-kick.\\n\\nHe’s a real talent, the Spain under-21 international, but the finishing still needs finessing. He’s underachieved on the xG front in his embryonic career so far, indeed.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 LINE-UP CLUES – NO LE FEE?\\n\\nUnlike the Machiavellian Eddie Howe up the road, Le Bris wasn’t messing about with his two teamsheets.\\n\\nThe team against Augsburg looked full strength, with the line-up against Vallecano anything but.\\n\\nBased on that evidence, Enzo Le Fee (£5.0m) looks set to be a starting XI casualty in Gameweek 1.\\n\\n“We’ll have two or three players like Enzo, really close to the starting XI but at the same time, we have to make a choice because we can only play with 11 players.” – Regis Le Bris\\n\\nTwo £4.0m defenders, Jenson Seelt (£4.0m) and Reinildo Mandava (£4.0m), are in pole position to start against West Ham.\\n\\nWhile Seelt is very likely a stopgap, Reinildo has an excellent chance to establish himself in the side longer term. He was lively at left-back, wriggling his way through to almost get a shooting chance not long before he won Sunderland’s penalty with another dash.\\n\\nRobin Roefs (£4.5m) meanwhile looks set to start between the posts, having kept a clean sheet and saved a penalty against Augsburg.\\n\\nGranit Xhaka (£5.0m) impressed again in midfield and hit the bar with one free-kick, while Diarra popped up in some eye-catchingly advanced positions and scored with one of his efforts. Simon Adingra (£5.5m) supplied the assist.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Augsburg: Roefs; Hume, Ballard, Seelt (J.Jones 83), Reinildo; Xhaka, Sadiki (Tuterovi 86), Diarra; Talbi, Adingra, Mayenda.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Vallecano: Patterson (Nna Noukeu 68); Huggins, Lavery (J. Jones 68), Triantis, H. Jones; Neil, Le Fée, Browne; Rigg (Aleksic 68), Roberts, Isidor (Tuterov 68).\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

I really REALLY want Munoz and Murillo, but I can\\'t find a way to have them both + VVD without really compromising somewhere else on my team. For example... 1. I\\'d have to do Fullkrug to Guiu, which feels like a dead spot on the bench + I plan on starting Big Nick for most of the first 5 GWs 2. I\\'d have to do Andersen to KDH and shave 0.5 elsewhere (Sanchez to 4.5m GK, Fullkrug to Piroe, Rogers to... someone :P) which feels like too much. 3. I could do Andersen to KDH and just go with Neco BUT he\\'s not the absolute defcon monster Murillo is + they\\'ve been linked with Davies so potential rotation risk So can someone talk me out of Munoz (I\\'d get Richards instead) or Murillo?

He needs to play and for sure, he is going to help. He is a fantastic player.” – Enzo Maresca on Estevao\\n\\nAbove: Estevao’s shot map v Leverkusen on Friday, via Sofascore\\n\\nPalmer, who regularly drifted into dangerous positions, went off at half-time, with Estevao taking over the No 10 role.\\n\\nSubstitute Joao Pedro (£7.5m) rounded it off late on, firing home in injury time.\\n\\nElsewhere, Jamie Gittens (£6.5m) was thrown on in the second half, but Christopher Nkunku (£6.0m) and Nicolas Jackson (£6.5m) were both left out of the matchday squad amid transfer speculation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Levi Colwill (£5.0m) is likely to miss the entirety of the 2025/26 season after sustaining a long-term injury.\\n\\nTrevoh Chalobah (£5.0m) took his place at Stamford Bridge on Friday, but it sounds like the club are already in the market for a new centre-back.\\n\\n“It is a priority for me, yes. Levi is a fantastic player; what we achieved last season was because of him. He played all games and I love him. We are going to miss him. We are trying to find different solutions. We will see [signing a defender].” – Enzo Maresca\\n\\nChelsea return to action on Sunday, as they host AC Milan, before turning their attention to Sunday’s Premier League opener against Crystal Palace.\\n\\nOn Friday’s evidence, they look more than ready.\\n\\nChelsea XI: Jorgensen; Gusto (James 64), Acheampong (Anselmino 76), Chalobah (Tosin 45), Cucurella (Hato 45); Caicedo (Essugo 45), Santos (Rak-Sakyi 76); Estevao (Antwi 67), Palmer (Neto 45), George (64); Delap (J Pedro 64)\\n\\nBRENTFORD 2-2 BORUSSIA MONCHENGLADBACH\\n\\nGoals: Carvalho, Damsgaard\\n\\nAssists: Collins\\n\\nCaoimhin Kelleher (£4.5m) was a surprise absentee for Brentford on Friday, having picked up a knock in training.\\n\\nKevin Schade (£7.0m) also missed out for the second pre-season friendly in a row.\\n\\nBoth players will be monitored over the coming days.\\n\\nAs for the on-pitch action, Fabio Carvalho (£5.0m) and Mikkel Damsgaard (£6.0m) both got on the scoresheet for Keith Andrews’ side.\\n\\nCarvalho, who has impressed in pre-season and attempted four shots here, volleyed home after a set-piece was headed across goal by Nathan Collins (£5.0m).\\n\\nA couple of minutes later, a loose pass was intercepted by Damsgaard, who made no mistake.\\n\\nNotably, Damsgaard’s set-piece deliveries were a real threat throughout at the Gtech Community Stadium.\\n\\nElsewhere, Keane Lewis-Potter (£5.0m) lined up out-of-position as a left winger. He put in some decent crosses and came close to scoring, only for his effort to deflect wide.\\n\\nIgor Thiago (£6.0m), however, looked isolated for large periods and registered just one shot which was blocked by the opposition.\\n\\nBrentford play again tomorrow against Gladbach at the training ground, with some of those who didn’t play on Friday expected to feature.\\n\\nBrentford XI: Valdimarrson; Kayode (Hickey 82), van den Berg (Ajer 62), Collins, Henry (Roerslev 82); Jensen (Milambo 75), Yarmoliuk; Carvalho, Damsgaard, Lewis-Potter; Thiago (Henderson 75)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n385 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nBagpuss\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n16 Years\\n\\n2 days, 14 hours ago\\n\\nHi - does anyone know if there have been any defence rotation articles yet please?

All you need to know about the rule changes\\n\\nAugust 11 1 comments\\n\\n11 August 2025 1 comments\\n\\nSkonto Rigga\\n\\nSkonto Rigga\\n\\nShare:\\n\\nIf you’re just signing up to Fantasy Premier League (FPL) this week, you may not be aware that there have been some rule changes for 2025/26 – and some significant ones, too!\\n\\nMore points for defensive-minded players. More assists. Twice as many chips. Bonus point tweaks. Extra transfers in December.\\n\\nHere’s all you need to know.\\n\\n1. Defensive contributions\\n\\nIt’s a big boost for defensive midfielders and centre-halves!\\n\\nOutfield players will now be rewarded for their defensive contributions with FPL points if they meet the following thresholds:\\n\\nREAD MORE:\\n\\nFPL 2025/26: Huge rule change as defensive contributions come in\\n\\nWhere you can find all of last season’s FPL defensive contribution points\\n\\nWhat is Rodri’s defensive contribution points potential in FPL?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a block?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a clearance?\\n\\nHow do Opta define an interception?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a tackle?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a recovery?\\n\\n2. Double the chips – but Assistant Manager gets the boot\\n\\nRIP the Assistant Manager chip!\\n\\nInstead, we’re getting two of every chip in 2025/26.\\n\\nNo new ones, just the old favourites of the last 10 years: Wildcard, Free Hit, Bench Boost and Triple Captain.\\n\\nSimilar to the use of the first Wildcard in recent seasons, we must play this first set of chips before the Gameweek 19 deadline passes.\\n\\nWe cannot carry them over into the second half of 2025/26.\\n\\nThe second set of chips then becomes available after the Gameweek 19 deadline has passed.\\n\\nOur initial thoughts can be found here.\\n\\n3. More assists to be awarded\\n\\nThere’ll be more assists in 2025/26, with the rules tweaked to be less strict.\\n\\nRules around handballs, defensive touches and, crucially, ‘intended destination/target’ have been relaxed.\\n\\nIf these new 2025/26 rules had been in operation last season, there would have been 41 extra Fantasy assists awarded!\\n\\nYou can read the full details here.\\n\\n4. Extra transfers for AFCON\\n\\nFantasy managers will be given extra free transfers in Gameweek 16 to help cope with the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) exodus in December.\\n\\nFPL bosses’ total number of free transfers will be topped up to the maximum possible number of five in Gameweek 16.\\n\\nYou can find more info here.\\n\\n5. Bonus Points System (BPS) changes\\n\\nThere have been some tweaks to the Bonus Points System (BPS) ahead of the new campaign.\\n\\nIt’s not a radical overhaul: the best-performing players (in terms of BPS scores) still receive one, two and three bonus points in every fixture.\\n\\nBut some of the numbers that go towards deciding this have been changed ahead of 2025/26.\\n\\nSave-making goalkeepers and goalline-clearing outfielders should be better off; those scoring penalties less so.\\n\\nThe full breakdown is here.\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

He was reportedly still in Hawaii on July 31!\\n\\nWe might be looking at a little while (potentially after the September international break?) in terms of starting contention, then, if he requires time to build up his match fitness.\\n\\nGuiu was followed into the club by Arthur Masuaku at the weekend, and Le Bris discussed the pair with reporters.\\n\\n“We are still in the process to improve the squad and progressively new signings like these two will help the squad, even if they started later. So, we’ll have to be patient with them, to build their foundations for the season.” – Regis Le Bris on Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku, to in-house club media\\n\\n“We’ll see. Every day, we will make an assessment of their level and see how far we can push them through the training sessions. Lift the intensity, the contact. If they react well, they can then join the squad. If they don’t react well, we wait one day, two days, and assess again. So we will see for next week.” – Regis Le Bris on whether Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku will be fit for Gameweek 1, via the Northern Echo\\n\\nANOTHER MISSED SUNDERLAND PENALTY!\\n\\nAfter Sunderland failed to score with four of their five penalties last season, a new taker was given the chance against Augsburg – and missed.\\n\\nEliezer Mayenda (£5.5m) took this latest effort, skying it over the bar.\\n\\nThat’s a blow for the budget striker’s FPL appeal, who has the chance to further his claim up front while Guiu is getting up to speed. Another positional rival, Wilson Isidor (£5.5m), is just back from injury,\\n\\nWill he get another chance from 12 yards or will someone like Habib Diarra (£5.5m), who took penalties for Strasbourg last season, get an opportunity? We shall see.\\n\\nMayenda has not had the best pre-season in front of goal in general. On Saturday again, it was everything but the goal. Lots of good movement but wasteful finishing, including two clear-cut chances aside from the spot-kick.\\n\\nHe’s a real talent, the Spain under-21 international, but the finishing still needs finessing. He’s underachieved on the xG front in his embryonic career so far, indeed.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 LINE-UP CLUES – NO LE FEE?\\n\\nUnlike the Machiavellian Eddie Howe up the road, Le Bris wasn’t messing about with his two teamsheets.\\n\\nThe team against Augsburg looked full strength, with the line-up against Vallecano anything but.\\n\\nBased on that evidence, Enzo Le Fee (£5.0m) looks set to be a starting XI casualty in Gameweek 1.\\n\\n“We’ll have two or three players like Enzo, really close to the starting XI but at the same time, we have to make a choice because we can only play with 11 players.” – Regis Le Bris\\n\\nTwo £4.0m defenders, Jenson Seelt (£4.0m) and Reinildo Mandava (£4.0m), are in pole position to start against West Ham.\\n\\nWhile Seelt is very likely a stopgap, Reinildo has an excellent chance to establish himself in the side longer term. He was lively at left-back, wriggling his way through to almost get a shooting chance not long before he won Sunderland’s penalty with another dash.\\n\\nRobin Roefs (£4.5m) meanwhile looks set to start between the posts, having kept a clean sheet and saved a penalty against Augsburg.\\n\\nGranit Xhaka (£5.0m) impressed again in midfield and hit the bar with one free-kick, while Diarra popped up in some eye-catchingly advanced positions and scored with one of his efforts. Simon Adingra (£5.5m) supplied the assist.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Augsburg: Roefs; Hume, Ballard, Seelt (J.Jones 83), Reinildo; Xhaka, Sadiki (Tuterovi 86), Diarra; Talbi, Adingra, Mayenda.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Vallecano: Patterson (Nna Noukeu 68); Huggins, Lavery (J. Jones 68), Triantis, H. Jones; Neil, Le Fée, Browne; Rigg (Aleksic 68), Roberts, Isidor (Tuterov 68).\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

I\\'d have to do Andersen to KDH and shave 0.5 elsewhere (Sanchez to 4.5m GK, Fullkrug to Piroe, Rogers to... someone :P) which feels like too much. 3. I could do Andersen to KDH and just go with Neco BUT he\\'s not the absolute defcon monster Murillo is + they\\'ve been linked with Davies so potential rotation risk So can someone talk me out of Munoz (I\\'d get Richards instead) or Murillo?

There’s Community Shield action, numerous pre-season friendlies and 20 press conferences to come.\\n\\nThe upcoming Scout Squad nominations will also help shape the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nBut this early selection, at the very least, gives a bit of a flavour of the players and teams we’ll be considering.\\n\\nABOUT THE SCOUT PICKS ‘BUS TEAM’\\n\\nThis ‘bus team’ selection is essentially a first draft of what we will finalise a week on Thursday.\\n\\nThere are, as ever, certain restrictions for our squad:\\n\\nAn £83.0m budget for our starting XI\\n\\nAn overall squad limit of £100.0m\\n\\nNo more than three players per team\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 FIXTURES\\n\\nAbove: The Gameweek 1 fixtures sorted by difficulty on our Season Ticker.\\n\\nTHE LIKELY LADS\\n\\nThroughout the 2024/25 season, Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) was rarely missing from the Scout Picks, and it is highly likely that he will feature once more in Gameweek 1 of the upcoming campaign.\\n\\nThe Egyptian smashed the all-time FPL points record last time around and will host Bournemouth a week on Friday. The Cherries have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga (£4.5m), Dean Huijsen, and, of course, Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) to Liverpool this summer.\\n\\nSalah has a history of starting strong, too, having delivered a return on the opening day of every campaign since his arrival on Merseyside in 2017.\\n\\nCole Palmer (£10.5m) may feature in our Scout Picks selection, too.\\n\\nDespite a poor period in early 2025, the 23-year-old bounced back at the FIFA Club World Cup, contributing three goals and two assists in six matches.\\n\\nREAD MORE: 6 things we learned about Chelsea from the Club World Cup\\n\\nHe has also returned in each of his last three appearances against Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace. Indeed, Palmer created more chances against the Eagles than any other side in the 2024/25 season (10).\\n\\nNottingham Forest defensive representation, be it through Matz Sels (£5.0m), Nikola Milenkovic (£5.5m) or Murillo (£5.5m), also looks on the cards, with Brentford up first at the City Ground.\\n\\nKeith Andrews’s side have, of course, sold Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) this summer, with Yoane Wissa (£7.5m) expected to join him through the exit door. The pair accounted for 39 of Brentford’s 66 Premier League goals last term.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brentford – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nFor the time being, we have opted for Sels; however, it is worth noting that both Milenkovic and Murillo would have recorded defensive contribution (DC) points in the corresponding fixture last season.\\n\\nFurther forward, Chris Wood (£7.5m) carries obvious appeal.\\n\\nIN CONTENTION\\n\\nIt is possible that we will include additional Liverpool players in the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nFlorian Wirtz (£8.5m) and Cody Gakpo (£7.5m) are very much on our radar. We will also consider Virgil van Dijk (£6.0m), should he be fit for Sunday’s Community Shield match against Crystal Palace.\\n\\nAnd what about Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m)? The attack-minded right-back netted five goals and provided 12 assists for Bayer Leverkusen last season and could start against Bournemouth, given the doubts currently surrounding Conor Bradley’s (£5.0m) fitness.\\n\\nHowever, midfield anchor Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m) is suspended for this clash. That could be a setback for Liverpool’s clean sheet prospects.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL pre-season: Bradley injury boosts Frimpong + Salah pen miss\\n\\nAs you can see, we’ve targeted the three newly-promoted teams in our early draft.\\n\\nThis year’s newcomers, Leeds United, Burnley and Sunderland, will surely fare better than last year’s group. Still, there are legitimate concerns, given how big the step up to the Premier League is.\\n\\nIliman Ndiaye (£6.5m), Mohammed Kudus (£6.5m) and Jarrod Bowen (£8.0m) subsequently make the cut.\\n\\nThey are joined by James Tarkowski (£5.5m), Pedro Porro (£5.5m) and El Hadji Malick Diouf (£4.5m).\\n\\nNo player in any position would have gained as many DC points as Tarkowski last season, with 44. Now back after injury, he should be ready to start in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nPorro, meanwhile, has retained set-piece duties in pre-season and should fit well with Thomas Frank’s approach.\\n\\nAs for Diouf, he scored seven goals and provided four assists for Slavia Prague last season. After a wobbly showing against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series, he bounced back with a superb display against Bournemouth on Sunday, claiming the assist for Bowen’s second-half strike with a wicked delivery from the left. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£4.5m) could be a neat alternative in the West Ham United ranks.\\n\\nOther backline options in the Gameweek 1 mix include Robert Sanchez (£5.0m), Marc Cucurella (£6.0m), Josko Gvardiol (£6.0m), Rayan Ait-Nouri (£6.0m) and Maxim De Cuyper (£4.5m), who you can read more about here.\\n\\nRepresentation from Aston Villa and Newcastle United’s attack may be a goer. This fixture has produced plenty of goals in recent times, with 25 (!) across their previous six encounters:\\n\\nAbove image from 11 v 11\\n\\nMorgan Rogers (£7.0m) and Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), perhaps even Donyell Malen (£5.5m), are viable candidates. Notably, Watkins inspired Villa to a statement win over Newcastle in April.\\n\\nHowever, Emiliano Martinez (£5.0m) is suspended in Gameweek 1, so a Newcastle attacker isn’t out of the question. Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) is perhaps the most likely; he could be on penalties if Alexander Isak (£10.5m) isn’t involved.\\n\\nElsewhere, Kaoru Mitoma’s (£6.5m) 198.8 minutes per expected goal involvement (xGI) in 2024/25 was the best of any Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder. He’s probably the most secure attacker, too, with Danny Welbeck (£6.5m), Georginio Rutter (£6.0m) and Matt O’Riley (£5.5m) potentially competing for two starting spots.\\n\\nThat said, Albion have struggled to break down Fulham’s defensive shape in recent times, scoring just five goals in their last eight meetings.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brighton – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nManchester City are playing away at Wolverhampton Wanderers in Gameweek 1, so Erling Haaland (£14.0m) won’t be far from our thoughts, yet there might be better uses of the funds. There are cheaper alternatives in Pep Guardiola’s squad, like Omar Marmoush (£8.5m), Rayan Cherki (£6.5m) and Tijjani Reijnders (£5.5m). Hopefully, Saturday’s friendly against Palermo will offer insights into Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up.\\n\\nTHE LONGER SHOTS\\n\\nYou wouldn’t bet against Bukayo Saka (£10.0m), Kai Havertz (£7.5m) or Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) finding the net against Manchester United, but there are probably better picks elsewhere in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nThe same applies to Arsenal’s backline options, such as David Raya (£5.5m), William Saliba (£6.0m) and Gabriel Magalhaes (£6.0m), given that there were some promising glimpses of United’s new-look attack against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series on Sunday.\\n\\nHowever, Bruno Fernandes (£9.0m) and co remain outsiders for selection, given the strength of Arsenal’s defence in recent times.\\n\\nIf we do decide to switch up the forwards, Jean-Philippe Mateta (£7.5m), Joao Pedro (£7.5m) and Jorgen Strand Larsen (£6.5m) could become possible shouts, although it feels unlikely at this early stage.\\n\\nFinally, Harry Wilson (£5.5m) could be a cheeky differential against Brighton. He’s scored five goals and provided one assist in pre-season.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 EARLY SCOUT PICKS\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n320 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nEmiliano Sala\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nWhy dubravka?\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAC/DC AFC\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n5 days, 23 hours ago\\n\\nBurnley are in for him so you could get a playing £4m goalkeeper.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nJimmy B\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n5 days, 23 hours ago\\n\\n4m Burnley keeper though don\\'t forget.

DEF - Rotating the five defenders into 3 appearances I can go all the way to GW 12. Almost every week the 3 defenders are playing against weak teams Off the 36 total appearances, 12 X 3 defenders in team you get the following 34 of 36 games are against weak teams, the 2 exceptions Spurs v Villa and Spurs v Chelsea in weeks 8 and 10 (1 transfer could resolve this) 10 of the 36 against the 3 promoted teams FORWARDS Muniz has the No 9 shirt. Started first few games last season only for Raul to end up getting most of game time. Raul\\'s contract ended. They have brought him back on a 1 year deal. Muniz has this year and 1 more year on his contract. This is his year to be starter with Fulham. Bringing back a 35 yr old Raul for 1 year is just insurance and back up. Muniz 11 goals and 2 assists in just 1265 mins last season. Approx 1/3rd of a season. If Muniz doesn\\'t work I can always play a 3-5-2 Watkins swopped into Gyokores around GW7 when Villa\\'s run of good fixtures end and Arsenal\\'s start MIDFIELD Malen - excellent run of fixtures 5.5. Will score and assist probably more than Rogers. With Rashford and Asensio gone one of them will play RW, the other No 10. Bundesliga - 30 G and 16 A in 5800 minutes(approx 1.8 prem lge seasons) Eredevise - 40 G 15 A in just 4700 minutes( approx 1.5 FPL seasons) Ah but thats them leagues you say. So OK Champions League 6 G 1 A in 1500 minutes Europa League 9G 1A in 1100 minutes Premiere League 3G in 298 minutes You do not sign a player with that productivity in the January window to have him sit on the bench this season. Nailed starter. Reijnders 5.5m Screw pep Roulette. His is a nailed on No 8 even if Rodri is back. Box to box will score and assist 8 a piece and get his share of DC Points. Look how many DC points Bruno Fernandez at 9m gets playing No 8 Pep doesnt put new signings straight into the fire with all the choices he has. Reijnders started 3 of the 4 games in 90 degree plus heat and was\\'nt substituted like his team mates around him. He also started alongside Rodri. So for me its Rodri 6 Reijnders 8 How many minutes did the other new signing grabbing the headlines get. Rayan Cherki. 30 minutes in 4 games compared to Reijnders 270 Carvalho - is Mbuemo\\'s natural replacement. You dont like him there\\'s plenty of other 5m fish in the sea. Onana(AV), Baleba(Brighton), Adams(BMouth) etc Just like Malen if he gets off to a good start his price will rise and now you have equity to use elsewhere in the team The BONUS if you read this far. I geared the entire team towards week 13. That\\'s wildcard week. Thats where there\\'s a significant swing in the fixtures. Liverpool, Man City and Newcastle have a ton of games against the 3 promoted teams. GW 13 to GW 19 Liverpool versus, Sunderland, Leeds and Leeds Man City versus, Leeds, Leeds and Sunderland Newcastle versus, Burnley, Sunderland, Burnley. Hope you all found this of use.

Only suggestion, with all the conjecture around Watkins, I would go safer, maybe a Bowen or a 7.5 and use the extra cash just to tidy up a couple of positions. Can go 4.5 > Neco, Kinsky > 4.5 (opening an early BB) or leave it if Dubravka moves, Carvalho > Anderson etc. Effectively, that 1.0 or 1.5 just removes a couple of question marks. If Watkins stays, then its a moot point, however worth having a backup plan that may slightly reduce your ceiling, but would substantially raise your floor!\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nmartynteresa\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n5 days, 20 hours ago\\n\\nYeah I forgot to put in the bit about GW1 BB Kinsky - pending what Farke does in last games of preseason and cup. Optional flip to Dubravka Hoever - looks like he has the starting spot. Gomes and H Bueno fighting for LB spot last game but Wolves just signed a LB so now its wait and see if Hoever has the starting RB spot. If unsure - James Hill will start for Bournemouth when Zabarnyi leaves. Rodon at Leeds has 6 out of 1st 9 games versus week teams including a really bad Everton team 1st game. Watched their 3 games in the Prem Lge summer series they are in serious trouble Watkins. Villa signed Guessard but he will not trouble Watkins for the 1st 7. If he goes to Man Utd and has Cunha,Mbuemo and Bruno all providing assists for him he is still good. Also watching Ekitike. At 8.5 in a high scoring Liverpool team he would giveme a 1/2m flex for Kinksy or Hoever Neco is my pick of the DC plays but not convinced that Forest defence will hold up like it did last year. They conceded in every 1 of their last 9 games at end of season. The more expensive DC\\'s at Arsenal, Citeh, Pool have tough fixtures. May not get as many clean sheets as they usually do in the early games\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pretender\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n5 days, 20 hours ago\\n\\nCompletely valid and again well thought out. Watkins - I am concerned Man U start poorly. He\\'s just a wait and see for me at this stage at 9.0 not a risk I want to take until the transfer speculation is tidied up. Like the Ekitike shout but it seems he will face some competition be that from Isak or from Gakpo if we sign a LW and miss on Isak. Fair points on both above. Only reason I am keen on a Tree\\'s DEF is their preseason attacking form has been dreadful which makes me think that Nuno will go back to what worked for them to start the year, not playing as open as they were when they started to think they were a genuine top 4 team, and go back to trying to win 1-0 or take 0-0 results particularly away from home. Quite glad that they\\'re easier fixtures are at home and tougher fixtures are away (outside of Burnley) in their first 7 as I think this lines up nicely with them getting 2-3 CS in this time and their DC guys getting them in the tougher fixtures.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nIN SANE IN DE BRUYNE\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n5 days, 19 hours ago\\n\\nGood reading.

It lists both injuries (\"knocks\") and bans separately, and the best part is that it shows the source for each update — whether it\\'s a press conference, club statement, or reliable media report. Makes it easier to know what’s real and what’s just rumor. They’ve already got a bunch of player statuses up (including some low-profile ones), and it’s updated daily. No ads or distractions — just availability info. Thought I’d share in case others are tweaking their drafts and want something simple and reliable.

Forest conceded in every 1 of their last 9 games. But again, nice fixture run. Rest looks good.

Cheers for the assessment. Regarding Malen, I just saw earlier from a reputable Villa source on X that this new signing can play RW? Moreover, he said he no longer considers Malen an option. It’s \"booking an early transfer\", apparently. At least Rogers is nailed for the fixture run. I\\'m prepared to take the risk on Forest\\'s defence again. In terms of defensive fixtures, it doesn\\'t get much better. They\\'ve proven they can do it, too. I agree with you\\'re thoughts on the expensive defenders not having good fixtures.

however, it is important to highlight that Fernandes racked up 12 defensive contributions, which included nine recoveries.\\n\\nAbove: Bruno Fernandes’ touch heatmap v Fiorentina on Saturday, via Sofascore\\n\\nBenjamin Sesko (£7.5m), meanwhile, was presented to supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford, having sealed his move from RB Leipzig earlier in the day.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL new signings: What does new Man Utd forward Sesko offer?\\n\\nTwo of United’s other summer additions, namely Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) and Matheus Cunha (£8.0m), did feature.\\n\\nNeither player looks fully fit, but Mbeumo carried a threat with some wicked deliveries into the box and spent the second half up front.\\n\\nHe also created four chances for his teammates.\\n\\nAs for Cunha, he played off the left and almost netted the winner when he got on the end of Fernandes’ cross, but his effort was deflected over.\\n\\n“I think they [Cunha and Mbeumo] are maybe 50/60 per cent of what they can do.

He would also have returned 30 defensive contribution points.\\n\\nPlay the fixtures\\n\\nTargeting the sides with kind schedules over the first four to six Gameweeks can help managers enjoy a strong start to the campaign.\\n\\nThere’s not as much need to look beyond that point as you have one free transfer each Gameweek to address any issues.\\n\\nChelsea\\'s opening six fixtures, for instance, are all ranked at three or below in the Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR), with one being the easiest possible match and five being the hardest.\\n\\nChelsea\\'s first six fixtures\\n\\nGameweek Opp. FDR* 1 Crystal Palace (H) 3 2 West Ham (A) 2 3 Fulham (H) 3 4 Brentford (A) 3 5 Man Utd (A) 3 6 Brighton (H) 3\\n\\n1=easiest possible fixture, 5=hardest possible fixture\\n\\nMarc Cucurella (£6.0m) is the standout option in Chelsea\\'s defence, having registered an impressive seven attacking returns last season.\\n\\nMoises Caicedo (£5.5m) could also deliver terrific value from the outset, too. Caicedo would have been one of the players to benefit the most from the addition of defensive contribution points last season. The midfielder would have registered an additional 42 points. As it was he registered 98 points for 12 clean sheets, one goal and four assists.\\n\\nDon’t take unnecessary risks\\n\\nWhen constructing your squad, look to limit the risk attached to each decision.\\n\\nIf a player is uncertain of featuring, for example, whether it be due to injury or a lack of pre-season action, simply leave them out and select someone more reliable.\\n\\nThis approach should be the same when picking your captain, who scores double points in each Gameweek.\\n\\nIn Gameweek 1 of 2025/26 Fantasy, picking a captain should be a relatively straightforward decision for most managers - Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) or Erling Haaland (£14.0m).\\n\\nSalah faces AFC Bournemouth having returned in every Gameweek 1 fixture he has played in, while Haaland will be up against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\\n\\nGranted, there are a number of strong alternatives such as Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Brennan Johnson (£7.0m), who face Crystal Palace and Burnley respectively. But with millions likely to rely on Haaland and Salah, captaining anyone other than these two stars seems an unnecessary risk to start the season.\\n\\nGo cheap on the bench\\n\\nManagers should look to invest heavily in their starting XI and mainly use the bench for cut-price picks who you can turn to in emergencies.\\n\\nFor goalkeepers, a wise approach is to pick a £4.5m starter who offers plenty of save points in addition to clean-sheet potential, and who has a deputy costing only £4.0m.\\n\\nAlternatively, rotate a pair of £4.5m \\'keepers according to their fixtures and spend no more than £9.0m.\\n\\nIn defence this season, all three promoted clubs have regular starters who cost only £4.0m. Burnley\\'s Maxime Esteve, Leeds United\\'s Gabriel Gudmundsson and Sunderland\\'s Reinildo Mandava can prove very valuable squad players, freeing up funds for the bigger spends in attack.\\n\\nA smart tactic can be to rotate your squad, swapping players from your starting XI to your bench in each Gameweek depending on who has a better fixture.\\n\\nIn this case, limit that tactic to budget \\'keepers and defenders and simply plough the rest of your budget into your starting XI.\\n\\nAs midfielders and forwards are far more likely to deliver huge points returns in Fantasy, managers should focus the majority of their funds in attack.\\n\\nAlthough this season managers should also weigh up the benefit of a cheap midfielder with good potential for defensive contribution points.\\n\\nPrice points can help structure your squad\\n\\nAn opening squad should be structured in such a way that a manager is well-placed to react to any early trends without the need for multiple transfers.\\n\\nAfter all, managers are only given one free transfer in each Gameweek, and every additional transfer costs four points.\\n\\nUsing price points across each outfield position is a key tactic for planning ahead.\\n\\nFor example, some managers may decide to start with Ollie Watkins (£9.0m) alongside Haaland as their second forward in a 3-5-2 formation.\\n\\nWatkins\\' cost of £9.0m essentially allows a single-transfer move to almost any other forward who costs the same or less, apart from Alexander Isak (£10.5m) and Haaland.\\n\\nIn midfield, by starting with Cole Palmer (£10.5m), managers need just one transfer to bring in any other player in this position apart from Salah.\\n\\nFor defenders, the £6.0m price point covers a host of key names such as Josko Gvardiol, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Virgil van Dijk, Marc Cucurella, Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba.\\n\\nBy starting the season with Van Dijk for Liverpool\\'s fixtures, managers could easily move to Gabriel or Saliba if Arsenal are looking as strong defensively as they did last season, or ahead of their fixture swing in Gameweek 7, where the opposition they face may not be as tough. This depends on price rises/falls, of course.\\n\\nDo your research\\n\\nAfter assessing the player price list for FPL 2025/26 and the fixtures, follow pre-season form, set-piece takers, new signings and any changes of head coach and/or tactics.\\n\\nThe more knowledge you can soak up, the better chance there is of gaining an early advantage over your mini-league rivals.\\n\\nBe patient\\n\\nDon’t pencil in a transfer for Gameweek 2 in advance. If a key player gets injured or dropped in Gameweek 1, you may have far more important issues to deal with than the move you were planning to make.\\n\\nInstead, managers should construct their squads in a way that avoids the need to make a transfer in Gameweek 2.\\n\\nThis affords the luxury of heading into Gameweek 3 with two free transfers, which can open up a lot more options for squad changes.\\n\\nFPL managers are now able to bank up to five free transfers, of course. There is, therefore, an opportunity to make more widespread changes in September by holding fire on buying/selling over the opening Gameweeks.\\n\\nCrucially, by keeping faith in their early plans and waiting until Gameweek 3 or later before making any changes, managers also have extra Gameweeks\\' worth of valuable new information to base their decisions on.\\n\\nFPL basics\\n\\nPart 1: How to register Part 2: How to pick a squad Part 3: Managing your team Part 4: How to make transfers Part 5: How FPL points are scored Part 6: How to use chips Part 7: Mini-leagues and FPL Cups Part 8: How to use the statistics menu'),\n",

however, it is important to highlight that Fernandes racked up 12 defensive contributions, which included nine recoveries.\\n\\nAbove: Bruno Fernandes’ touch heatmap v Fiorentina on Saturday, via Sofascore\\n\\nBenjamin Sesko (£7.5m), meanwhile, was presented to supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford, having sealed his move from RB Leipzig earlier in the day.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL new signings: What does new Man Utd forward Sesko offer?\\n\\nTwo of United’s other summer additions, namely Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) and Matheus Cunha (£8.0m), did feature.\\n\\nNeither player looks fully fit, but Mbeumo carried a threat with some wicked deliveries into the box and spent the second half up front.\\n\\nHe also created four chances for his teammates.\\n\\nAs for Cunha, he played off the left and almost netted the winner when he got on the end of Fernandes’ cross, but his effort was deflected over.\\n\\n“I think they [Cunha and Mbeumo] are maybe 50/60 per cent of what they can do. I think, like any other team, we are going to improve during the season, they are going to be so much better. In some moments I felt that we, because of the one-v-one in all the pitch, we struggle without a reference as a striker. We have a new player [Sesko] so we’ll see.” – Ruben Amorim\\n\\nWith only Andre Onana (£5.0m) and Joshua Zirkzee (£6.0m) absent for United – they trained on Monday – the starting XI hinted at Ruben Amorim’s line-up plans for the opener against Arsenal.\\n\\nManchester United XI: Bayindir; Yoro, Maguire (de Ligt 73), Heaven (Shaw 73); Amad, Casemiro (Mainoo 73), Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo (Dalot 73), Cunha; Mount (Ugarte 84)\\n\\nNOTTINGHAM FOREST 0-0 AL-QADSIAH\\n\\nNottingham Forest concluded their pre-season preparations with another lacklustre result, as they recorded their fifth goalless draw of the summer.\\n\\nIt means Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have scored just one goal in seven pre-season friendlies.\\n\\nAgainst Al-Qadsiah, summer signing Igor Jesus (£6.0m) partnered Chris Wood (£7.5m) up front and headed a couple of efforts wide.\\n\\nSubstitutes Jota Silva (£4.5m) and Taiwo Awoniyi (£5.5m) were later denied, but Forest once again failed to find the breakthrough.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.5m) should provide some creativity in the No 10 role. He missed out here due to a family matter.\\n\\nFive clean sheets in pre-season does at least offer some optimism ahead of Sunday’s opener against Brentford.\\n\\n“We have kept a solidity at the back and within the team. Everyone is defending well… that is a positive. Of course, we would like to score a lot more goals but it is pre-season. The real business starts next week. That is when we must find the back of the net.” – Ola Aina\\n\\nNeco Williams (£5.0m), meanwhile, linked well with Callum Hudson-Odoi (£6.0m) down Forest’s left flank and created a couple of chances for Jesus.\\n\\nNottingham Forest XI: Sels; Aina (Cunha 61), Murillo (Awoniyi 77), Milenkovic (Boly 61), Williams (Morato 77); Ndoye (Richards 77), Anderson (Sangare 61), Yates, Hudson-Odoi (Moreira 77); Wood (Stamenic 77), Jesus (Jota 61)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n540 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nBlzE_94\\n\\n10 Years\\n\\n2 hours, 25 mins ago\\n\\nWho would you captain here?

There’s Community Shield action, numerous pre-season friendlies and 20 press conferences to come.\\n\\nThe upcoming Scout Squad nominations will also help shape the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nBut this early selection, at the very least, gives a bit of a flavour of the players and teams we’ll be considering.\\n\\nABOUT THE SCOUT PICKS ‘BUS TEAM’\\n\\nThis ‘bus team’ selection is essentially a first draft of what we will finalise a week on Thursday.\\n\\nThere are, as ever, certain restrictions for our squad:\\n\\nAn £83.0m budget for our starting XI\\n\\nAn overall squad limit of £100.0m\\n\\nNo more than three players per team\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 FIXTURES\\n\\nAbove: The Gameweek 1 fixtures sorted by difficulty on our Season Ticker.\\n\\nTHE LIKELY LADS\\n\\nThroughout the 2024/25 season, Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) was rarely missing from the Scout Picks, and it is highly likely that he will feature once more in Gameweek 1 of the upcoming campaign.\\n\\nThe Egyptian smashed the all-time FPL points record last time around and will host Bournemouth a week on Friday. The Cherries have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga (£4.5m), Dean Huijsen, and, of course, Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) to Liverpool this summer.\\n\\nSalah has a history of starting strong, too, having delivered a return on the opening day of every campaign since his arrival on Merseyside in 2017.\\n\\nCole Palmer (£10.5m) may feature in our Scout Picks selection, too.\\n\\nDespite a poor period in early 2025, the 23-year-old bounced back at the FIFA Club World Cup, contributing three goals and two assists in six matches.\\n\\nREAD MORE: 6 things we learned about Chelsea from the Club World Cup\\n\\nHe has also returned in each of his last three appearances against Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace. Indeed, Palmer created more chances against the Eagles than any other side in the 2024/25 season (10).\\n\\nNottingham Forest defensive representation, be it through Matz Sels (£5.0m), Nikola Milenkovic (£5.5m) or Murillo (£5.5m), also looks on the cards, with Brentford up first at the City Ground.\\n\\nKeith Andrews’s side have, of course, sold Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) this summer, with Yoane Wissa (£7.5m) expected to join him through the exit door. The pair accounted for 39 of Brentford’s 66 Premier League goals last term.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brentford – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nFor the time being, we have opted for Sels; however, it is worth noting that both Milenkovic and Murillo would have recorded defensive contribution (DC) points in the corresponding fixture last season.\\n\\nFurther forward, Chris Wood (£7.5m) carries obvious appeal.\\n\\nIN CONTENTION\\n\\nIt is possible that we will include additional Liverpool players in the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nFlorian Wirtz (£8.5m) and Cody Gakpo (£7.5m) are very much on our radar. We will also consider Virgil van Dijk (£6.0m), should he be fit for Sunday’s Community Shield match against Crystal Palace.\\n\\nAnd what about Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m)? The attack-minded right-back netted five goals and provided 12 assists for Bayer Leverkusen last season and could start against Bournemouth, given the doubts currently surrounding Conor Bradley’s (£5.0m) fitness.\\n\\nHowever, midfield anchor Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m) is suspended for this clash. That could be a setback for Liverpool’s clean sheet prospects.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL pre-season: Bradley injury boosts Frimpong + Salah pen miss\\n\\nAs you can see, we’ve targeted the three newly-promoted teams in our early draft.\\n\\nThis year’s newcomers, Leeds United, Burnley and Sunderland, will surely fare better than last year’s group. Still, there are legitimate concerns, given how big the step up to the Premier League is.\\n\\nIliman Ndiaye (£6.5m), Mohammed Kudus (£6.5m) and Jarrod Bowen (£8.0m) subsequently make the cut.\\n\\nThey are joined by James Tarkowski (£5.5m), Pedro Porro (£5.5m) and El Hadji Malick Diouf (£4.5m).\\n\\nNo player in any position would have gained as many DC points as Tarkowski last season, with 44. Now back after injury, he should be ready to start in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nPorro, meanwhile, has retained set-piece duties in pre-season and should fit well with Thomas Frank’s approach.\\n\\nAs for Diouf, he scored seven goals and provided four assists for Slavia Prague last season. After a wobbly showing against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series, he bounced back with a superb display against Bournemouth on Sunday, claiming the assist for Bowen’s second-half strike with a wicked delivery from the left. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£4.5m) could be a neat alternative in the West Ham United ranks.\\n\\nOther backline options in the Gameweek 1 mix include Robert Sanchez (£5.0m), Marc Cucurella (£6.0m), Josko Gvardiol (£6.0m), Rayan Ait-Nouri (£6.0m) and Maxim De Cuyper (£4.5m), who you can read more about here.\\n\\nRepresentation from Aston Villa and Newcastle United’s attack may be a goer. This fixture has produced plenty of goals in recent times, with 25 (!) across their previous six encounters:\\n\\nAbove image from 11 v 11\\n\\nMorgan Rogers (£7.0m) and Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), perhaps even Donyell Malen (£5.5m), are viable candidates. Notably, Watkins inspired Villa to a statement win over Newcastle in April.\\n\\nHowever, Emiliano Martinez (£5.0m) is suspended in Gameweek 1, so a Newcastle attacker isn’t out of the question. Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) is perhaps the most likely; he could be on penalties if Alexander Isak (£10.5m) isn’t involved.\\n\\nElsewhere, Kaoru Mitoma’s (£6.5m) 198.8 minutes per expected goal involvement (xGI) in 2024/25 was the best of any Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder. He’s probably the most secure attacker, too, with Danny Welbeck (£6.5m), Georginio Rutter (£6.0m) and Matt O’Riley (£5.5m) potentially competing for two starting spots.\\n\\nThat said, Albion have struggled to break down Fulham’s defensive shape in recent times, scoring just five goals in their last eight meetings.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brighton – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nManchester City are playing away at Wolverhampton Wanderers in Gameweek 1, so Erling Haaland (£14.0m) won’t be far from our thoughts, yet there might be better uses of the funds. There are cheaper alternatives in Pep Guardiola’s squad, like Omar Marmoush (£8.5m), Rayan Cherki (£6.5m) and Tijjani Reijnders (£5.5m). Hopefully, Saturday’s friendly against Palermo will offer insights into Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up.\\n\\nTHE LONGER SHOTS\\n\\nYou wouldn’t bet against Bukayo Saka (£10.0m), Kai Havertz (£7.5m) or Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) finding the net against Manchester United, but there are probably better picks elsewhere in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nThe same applies to Arsenal’s backline options, such as David Raya (£5.5m), William Saliba (£6.0m) and Gabriel Magalhaes (£6.0m), given that there were some promising glimpses of United’s new-look attack against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series on Sunday.\\n\\nHowever, Bruno Fernandes (£9.0m) and co remain outsiders for selection, given the strength of Arsenal’s defence in recent times.\\n\\nIf we do decide to switch up the forwards, Jean-Philippe Mateta (£7.5m), Joao Pedro (£7.5m) and Jorgen Strand Larsen (£6.5m) could become possible shouts, although it feels unlikely at this early stage.\\n\\nFinally, Harry Wilson (£5.5m) could be a cheeky differential against Brighton. He’s scored five goals and provided one assist in pre-season.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 EARLY SCOUT PICKS\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n320 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nEmiliano Sala\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nWhy dubravka?\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAC/DC AFC\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nBurnley are in for him so you could get a playing £4m goalkeeper.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nJimmy B\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\n4m Burnley keeper though don\\'t forget.

DEF - Rotating the five defenders into 3 appearances I can go all the way to GW 12. Almost every week the 3 defenders are playing against weak teams Off the 36 total appearances, 12 X 3 defenders in team you get the following 34 of 36 games are against weak teams, the 2 exceptions Spurs v Villa and Spurs v Chelsea in weeks 8 and 10 (1 transfer could resolve this) 10 of the 36 against the 3 promoted teams FORWARDS Muniz has the No 9 shirt. Started first few games last season only for Raul to end up getting most of game time. Raul\\'s contract ended. They have brought him back on a 1 year deal. Muniz has this year and 1 more year on his contract. This is his year to be starter with Fulham. Bringing back a 35 yr old Raul for 1 year is just insurance and back up. Muniz 11 goals and 2 assists in just 1265 mins last season. Approx 1/3rd of a season. If Muniz doesn\\'t work I can always play a 3-5-2 Watkins swopped into Gyokores around GW7 when Villa\\'s run of good fixtures end and Arsenal\\'s start MIDFIELD Malen - excellent run of fixtures 5.5. Will score and assist probably more than Rogers. With Rashford and Asensio gone one of them will play RW, the other No 10. Bundesliga - 30 G and 16 A in 5800 minutes(approx 1.8 prem lge seasons) Eredevise - 40 G 15 A in just 4700 minutes( approx 1.5 FPL seasons) Ah but thats them leagues you say. So OK Champions League 6 G 1 A in 1500 minutes Europa League 9G 1A in 1100 minutes Premiere League 3G in 298 minutes You do not sign a player with that productivity in the January window to have him sit on the bench this season. Nailed starter. Reijnders 5.5m Screw pep Roulette. His is a nailed on No 8 even if Rodri is back. Box to box will score and assist 8 a piece and get his share of DC Points. Look how many DC points Bruno Fernandez at 9m gets playing No 8 Pep doesnt put new signings straight into the fire with all the choices he has. Reijnders started 3 of the 4 games in 90 degree plus heat and was\\'nt substituted like his team mates around him. He also started alongside Rodri. So for me its Rodri 6 Reijnders 8 How many minutes did the other new signing grabbing the headlines get. Rayan Cherki. 30 minutes in 4 games compared to Reijnders 270 Carvalho - is Mbuemo\\'s natural replacement. You dont like him there\\'s plenty of other 5m fish in the sea. Onana(AV), Baleba(Brighton), Adams(BMouth) etc Just like Malen if he gets off to a good start his price will rise and now you have equity to use elsewhere in the team The BONUS if you read this far. I geared the entire team towards week 13. That\\'s wildcard week. Thats where there\\'s a significant swing in the fixtures. Liverpool, Man City and Newcastle have a ton of games against the 3 promoted teams. GW 13 to GW 19 Liverpool versus, Sunderland, Leeds and Leeds Man City versus, Leeds, Leeds and Sunderland Newcastle versus, Burnley, Sunderland, Burnley. Hope you all found this of use.

Only suggestion, with all the conjecture around Watkins, I would go safer, maybe a Bowen or a 7.5 and use the extra cash just to tidy up a couple of positions. Can go 4.5 > Neco, Kinsky > 4.5 (opening an early BB) or leave it if Dubravka moves, Carvalho > Anderson etc. Effectively, that 1.0 or 1.5 just removes a couple of question marks. If Watkins stays, then its a moot point, however worth having a backup plan that may slightly reduce your ceiling, but would substantially raise your floor!\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nmartynteresa\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n5 days, 21 hours ago\\n\\nYeah I forgot to put in the bit about GW1 BB Kinsky - pending what Farke does in last games of preseason and cup. Optional flip to Dubravka Hoever - looks like he has the starting spot. Gomes and H Bueno fighting for LB spot last game but Wolves just signed a LB so now its wait and see if Hoever has the starting RB spot. If unsure - James Hill will start for Bournemouth when Zabarnyi leaves. Rodon at Leeds has 6 out of 1st 9 games versus week teams including a really bad Everton team 1st game. Watched their 3 games in the Prem Lge summer series they are in serious trouble Watkins. Villa signed Guessard but he will not trouble Watkins for the 1st 7. If he goes to Man Utd and has Cunha,Mbuemo and Bruno all providing assists for him he is still good. Also watching Ekitike. At 8.5 in a high scoring Liverpool team he would giveme a 1/2m flex for Kinksy or Hoever Neco is my pick of the DC plays but not convinced that Forest defence will hold up like it did last year. They conceded in every 1 of their last 9 games at end of season. The more expensive DC\\'s at Arsenal, Citeh, Pool have tough fixtures. May not get as many clean sheets as they usually do in the early games\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pretender\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n5 days, 21 hours ago\\n\\nCompletely valid and again well thought out. Watkins - I am concerned Man U start poorly. He\\'s just a wait and see for me at this stage at 9.0 not a risk I want to take until the transfer speculation is tidied up. Like the Ekitike shout but it seems he will face some competition be that from Isak or from Gakpo if we sign a LW and miss on Isak. Fair points on both above. Only reason I am keen on a Tree\\'s DEF is their preseason attacking form has been dreadful which makes me think that Nuno will go back to what worked for them to start the year, not playing as open as they were when they started to think they were a genuine top 4 team, and go back to trying to win 1-0 or take 0-0 results particularly away from home. Quite glad that they\\'re easier fixtures are at home and tougher fixtures are away (outside of Burnley) in their first 7 as I think this lines up nicely with them getting 2-3 CS in this time and their DC guys getting them in the tougher fixtures.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nIN SANE IN DE BRUYNE\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n5 days, 21 hours ago\\n\\nGood reading.

It lists both injuries (\"knocks\") and bans separately, and the best part is that it shows the source for each update — whether it\\'s a press conference, club statement, or reliable media report. Makes it easier to know what’s real and what’s just rumor. They’ve already got a bunch of player statuses up (including some low-profile ones), and it’s updated daily. No ads or distractions — just availability info. Thought I’d share in case others are tweaking their drafts and want something simple and reliable.

I cant help feeling that because Rogers was the value surprise last year that he is now mandatory in almost everyone\\'s team. He is not 4.5m anymore. But the fixture run is good so. Forest conceded in every 1 of their last 9 games. But again, nice fixture run. Rest looks good.

Cheers for the assessment. Regarding Malen, I just saw earlier from a reputable Villa source on X that this new signing can play RW? Moreover, he said he no longer considers Malen an option. It’s \"booking an early transfer\", apparently. At least Rogers is nailed for the fixture run. I\\'m prepared to take the risk on Forest\\'s defence again. In terms of defensive fixtures, it doesn\\'t get much better. They\\'ve proven they can do it, too. I agree with you\\'re thoughts on the expensive defenders not having good fixtures. It\\'s a damn shame I can\\'t trust Chelsea at the back because Cucurella has a nice run.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nmartynteresa\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n5 days, 21 hours ago\\n\\nNot seen anything about Malen wanting out. I will keep an eye on that, thx. He\\'s got 3 assists and a couple of goals I think in pre season. Yes newbie can play RW but I doubt he would jump over Rogers/Malen in the 1st 7 weeks. You know the usual, get him settled in, get his fitness level right, get him used to the tactics and whats expected of him.

He was reportedly still in Hawaii on July 31!\\n\\nWe might be looking at a little while (potentially after the September international break?) in terms of starting contention, then, if he requires time to build up his match fitness.\\n\\nGuiu was followed into the club by Arthur Masuaku at the weekend, and Le Bris discussed the pair with reporters.\\n\\n“We are still in the process to improve the squad and progressively new signings like these two will help the squad, even if they started later. So, we’ll have to be patient with them, to build their foundations for the season.” – Regis Le Bris on Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku, to in-house club media\\n\\n“We’ll see. Every day, we will make an assessment of their level and see how far we can push them through the training sessions. Lift the intensity, the contact. If they react well, they can then join the squad. If they don’t react well, we wait one day, two days, and assess again. So we will see for next week.” – Regis Le Bris on whether Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku will be fit for Gameweek 1, via the Northern Echo\\n\\nANOTHER MISSED SUNDERLAND PENALTY!\\n\\nAfter Sunderland failed to score with four of their five penalties last season, a new taker was given the chance against Augsburg – and missed.\\n\\nEliezer Mayenda (£5.5m) took this latest effort, skying it over the bar.\\n\\nThat’s a blow for the budget striker’s FPL appeal, who has the chance to further his claim up front while Guiu is getting up to speed. Another positional rival, Wilson Isidor (£5.5m), is just back from injury,\\n\\nWill he get another chance from 12 yards or will someone like Habib Diarra (£5.5m), who took penalties for Strasbourg last season, get an opportunity? We shall see.\\n\\nMayenda has not had the best pre-season in front of goal in general. On Saturday again, it was everything but the goal. Lots of good movement but wasteful finishing, including two clear-cut chances aside from the spot-kick.\\n\\nHe’s a real talent, the Spain under-21 international, but the finishing still needs finessing. He’s underachieved on the xG front in his embryonic career so far, indeed.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 LINE-UP CLUES – NO LE FEE?\\n\\nUnlike the Machiavellian Eddie Howe up the road, Le Bris wasn’t messing about with his two teamsheets.\\n\\nThe team against Augsburg looked full strength, with the line-up against Vallecano anything but.\\n\\nBased on that evidence, Enzo Le Fee (£5.0m) looks set to be a starting XI casualty in Gameweek 1.\\n\\n“We’ll have two or three players like Enzo, really close to the starting XI but at the same time, we have to make a choice because we can only play with 11 players.” – Regis Le Bris\\n\\nTwo £4.0m defenders, Jenson Seelt (£4.0m) and Reinildo Mandava (£4.0m), are in pole position to start against West Ham.\\n\\nWhile Seelt is very likely a stopgap, Reinildo has an excellent chance to establish himself in the side longer term. He was lively at left-back, wriggling his way through to almost get a shooting chance not long before he won Sunderland’s penalty with another dash.\\n\\nRobin Roefs (£4.5m) meanwhile looks set to start between the posts, having kept a clean sheet and saved a penalty against Augsburg.\\n\\nGranit Xhaka (£5.0m) impressed again in midfield and hit the bar with one free-kick, while Diarra popped up in some eye-catchingly advanced positions and scored with one of his efforts. Simon Adingra (£5.5m) supplied the assist.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Augsburg: Roefs; Hume, Ballard, Seelt (J.Jones 83), Reinildo; Xhaka, Sadiki (Tuterovi 86), Diarra; Talbi, Adingra, Mayenda.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Vallecano: Patterson (Nna Noukeu 68); Huggins, Lavery (J. Jones 68), Triantis, H. Jones; Neil, Le Fée, Browne; Rigg (Aleksic 68), Roberts, Isidor (Tuterov 68).\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

I\\'d have to do Andersen to KDH and shave 0.5 elsewhere (Sanchez to 4.5m GK, Fullkrug to Piroe, Rogers to... someone :P) which feels like too much. 3. I could do Andersen to KDH and just go with Neco BUT he\\'s not the absolute defcon monster Murillo is + they\\'ve been linked with Davies so potential rotation risk So can someone talk me out of Munoz (I\\'d get Richards instead) or Murillo?

He needs to play and for sure, he is going to help. He is a fantastic player.” – Enzo Maresca on Estevao\\n\\nAbove: Estevao’s shot map v Leverkusen on Friday, via Sofascore\\n\\nPalmer, who regularly drifted into dangerous positions, went off at half-time, with Estevao taking over the No 10 role.\\n\\nSubstitute Joao Pedro (£7.5m) rounded it off late on, firing home in injury time.\\n\\nElsewhere, Jamie Gittens (£6.5m) was thrown on in the second half, but Christopher Nkunku (£6.0m) and Nicolas Jackson (£6.5m) were both left out of the matchday squad amid transfer speculation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Levi Colwill (£5.0m) is likely to miss the entirety of the 2025/26 season after sustaining a long-term injury.\\n\\nTrevoh Chalobah (£5.0m) took his place at Stamford Bridge on Friday, but it sounds like the club are already in the market for a new centre-back.\\n\\n“It is a priority for me, yes. Levi is a fantastic player; what we achieved last season was because of him. He played all games and I love him. We are going to miss him. We are trying to find different solutions. We will see [signing a defender].” – Enzo Maresca\\n\\nChelsea return to action on Sunday, as they host AC Milan, before turning their attention to Sunday’s Premier League opener against Crystal Palace.\\n\\nOn Friday’s evidence, they look more than ready.\\n\\nChelsea XI: Jorgensen; Gusto (James 64), Acheampong (Anselmino 76), Chalobah (Tosin 45), Cucurella (Hato 45); Caicedo (Essugo 45), Santos (Rak-Sakyi 76); Estevao (Antwi 67), Palmer (Neto 45), George (64); Delap (J Pedro 64)\\n\\nBRENTFORD 2-2 BORUSSIA MONCHENGLADBACH\\n\\nGoals: Carvalho, Damsgaard\\n\\nAssists: Collins\\n\\nCaoimhin Kelleher (£4.5m) was a surprise absentee for Brentford on Friday, having picked up a knock in training.\\n\\nKevin Schade (£7.0m) also missed out for the second pre-season friendly in a row.\\n\\nBoth players will be monitored over the coming days.\\n\\nAs for the on-pitch action, Fabio Carvalho (£5.0m) and Mikkel Damsgaard (£6.0m) both got on the scoresheet for Keith Andrews’ side.\\n\\nCarvalho, who has impressed in pre-season and attempted four shots here, volleyed home after a set-piece was headed across goal by Nathan Collins (£5.0m).\\n\\nA couple of minutes later, a loose pass was intercepted by Damsgaard, who made no mistake.\\n\\nNotably, Damsgaard’s set-piece deliveries were a real threat throughout at the Gtech Community Stadium.\\n\\nElsewhere, Keane Lewis-Potter (£5.0m) lined up out-of-position as a left winger. He put in some decent crosses and came close to scoring, only for his effort to deflect wide.\\n\\nIgor Thiago (£6.0m), however, looked isolated for large periods and registered just one shot which was blocked by the opposition.\\n\\nBrentford play again tomorrow against Gladbach at the training ground, with some of those who didn’t play on Friday expected to feature.\\n\\nBrentford XI: Valdimarrson; Kayode (Hickey 82), van den Berg (Ajer 62), Collins, Henry (Roerslev 82); Jensen (Milambo 75), Yarmoliuk; Carvalho, Damsgaard, Lewis-Potter; Thiago (Henderson 75)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n385 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nBagpuss\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n16 Years\\n\\n2 days, 14 hours ago\\n\\nHi - does anyone know if there have been any defence rotation articles yet please?

All you need to know about the rule changes\\n\\nAugust 11 1 comments\\n\\n11 August 2025 1 comments\\n\\nSkonto Rigga\\n\\nSkonto Rigga\\n\\nShare:\\n\\nIf you’re just signing up to Fantasy Premier League (FPL) this week, you may not be aware that there have been some rule changes for 2025/26 – and some significant ones, too!\\n\\nMore points for defensive-minded players. More assists. Twice as many chips. Bonus point tweaks. Extra transfers in December.\\n\\nHere’s all you need to know.\\n\\n1. Defensive contributions\\n\\nIt’s a big boost for defensive midfielders and centre-halves!\\n\\nOutfield players will now be rewarded for their defensive contributions with FPL points if they meet the following thresholds:\\n\\nREAD MORE:\\n\\nFPL 2025/26: Huge rule change as defensive contributions come in\\n\\nWhere you can find all of last season’s FPL defensive contribution points\\n\\nWhat is Rodri’s defensive contribution points potential in FPL?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a block?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a clearance?\\n\\nHow do Opta define an interception?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a tackle?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a recovery?\\n\\n2. Double the chips – but Assistant Manager gets the boot\\n\\nRIP the Assistant Manager chip!\\n\\nInstead, we’re getting two of every chip in 2025/26.\\n\\nNo new ones, just the old favourites of the last 10 years: Wildcard, Free Hit, Bench Boost and Triple Captain.\\n\\nSimilar to the use of the first Wildcard in recent seasons, we must play this first set of chips before the Gameweek 19 deadline passes.\\n\\nWe cannot carry them over into the second half of 2025/26.\\n\\nThe second set of chips then becomes available after the Gameweek 19 deadline has passed.\\n\\nOur initial thoughts can be found here.\\n\\n3. More assists to be awarded\\n\\nThere’ll be more assists in 2025/26, with the rules tweaked to be less strict.\\n\\nRules around handballs, defensive touches and, crucially, ‘intended destination/target’ have been relaxed.\\n\\nIf these new 2025/26 rules had been in operation last season, there would have been 41 extra Fantasy assists awarded!\\n\\nYou can read the full details here.\\n\\n4. Extra transfers for AFCON\\n\\nFantasy managers will be given extra free transfers in Gameweek 16 to help cope with the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) exodus in December.\\n\\nFPL bosses’ total number of free transfers will be topped up to the maximum possible number of five in Gameweek 16.\\n\\nYou can find more info here.\\n\\n5. Bonus Points System (BPS) changes\\n\\nThere have been some tweaks to the Bonus Points System (BPS) ahead of the new campaign.\\n\\nIt’s not a radical overhaul: the best-performing players (in terms of BPS scores) still receive one, two and three bonus points in every fixture.\\n\\nBut some of the numbers that go towards deciding this have been changed ahead of 2025/26.\\n\\nSave-making goalkeepers and goalline-clearing outfielders should be better off; those scoring penalties less so.\\n\\nThe full breakdown is here.\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

He was reportedly still in Hawaii on July 31!\\n\\nWe might be looking at a little while (potentially after the September international break?) in terms of starting contention, then, if he requires time to build up his match fitness.\\n\\nGuiu was followed into the club by Arthur Masuaku at the weekend, and Le Bris discussed the pair with reporters.\\n\\n“We are still in the process to improve the squad and progressively new signings like these two will help the squad, even if they started later. So, we’ll have to be patient with them, to build their foundations for the season.” – Regis Le Bris on Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku, to in-house club media\\n\\n“We’ll see. Every day, we will make an assessment of their level and see how far we can push them through the training sessions. Lift the intensity, the contact. If they react well, they can then join the squad. If they don’t react well, we wait one day, two days, and assess again. So we will see for next week.” – Regis Le Bris on whether Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku will be fit for Gameweek 1, via the Northern Echo\\n\\nANOTHER MISSED SUNDERLAND PENALTY!\\n\\nAfter Sunderland failed to score with four of their five penalties last season, a new taker was given the chance against Augsburg – and missed.\\n\\nEliezer Mayenda (£5.5m) took this latest effort, skying it over the bar.\\n\\nThat’s a blow for the budget striker’s FPL appeal, who has the chance to further his claim up front while Guiu is getting up to speed. Another positional rival, Wilson Isidor (£5.5m), is just back from injury,\\n\\nWill he get another chance from 12 yards or will someone like Habib Diarra (£5.5m), who took penalties for Strasbourg last season, get an opportunity? We shall see.\\n\\nMayenda has not had the best pre-season in front of goal in general. On Saturday again, it was everything but the goal. Lots of good movement but wasteful finishing, including two clear-cut chances aside from the spot-kick.\\n\\nHe’s a real talent, the Spain under-21 international, but the finishing still needs finessing. He’s underachieved on the xG front in his embryonic career so far, indeed.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 LINE-UP CLUES – NO LE FEE?\\n\\nUnlike the Machiavellian Eddie Howe up the road, Le Bris wasn’t messing about with his two teamsheets.\\n\\nThe team against Augsburg looked full strength, with the line-up against Vallecano anything but.\\n\\nBased on that evidence, Enzo Le Fee (£5.0m) looks set to be a starting XI casualty in Gameweek 1.\\n\\n“We’ll have two or three players like Enzo, really close to the starting XI but at the same time, we have to make a choice because we can only play with 11 players.” – Regis Le Bris\\n\\nTwo £4.0m defenders, Jenson Seelt (£4.0m) and Reinildo Mandava (£4.0m), are in pole position to start against West Ham.\\n\\nWhile Seelt is very likely a stopgap, Reinildo has an excellent chance to establish himself in the side longer term. He was lively at left-back, wriggling his way through to almost get a shooting chance not long before he won Sunderland’s penalty with another dash.\\n\\nRobin Roefs (£4.5m) meanwhile looks set to start between the posts, having kept a clean sheet and saved a penalty against Augsburg.\\n\\nGranit Xhaka (£5.0m) impressed again in midfield and hit the bar with one free-kick, while Diarra popped up in some eye-catchingly advanced positions and scored with one of his efforts. Simon Adingra (£5.5m) supplied the assist.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Augsburg: Roefs; Hume, Ballard, Seelt (J.Jones 83), Reinildo; Xhaka, Sadiki (Tuterovi 86), Diarra; Talbi, Adingra, Mayenda.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Vallecano: Patterson (Nna Noukeu 68); Huggins, Lavery (J. Jones 68), Triantis, H. Jones; Neil, Le Fée, Browne; Rigg (Aleksic 68), Roberts, Isidor (Tuterov 68).\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

I\\'d have to do Andersen to KDH and shave 0.5 elsewhere (Sanchez to 4.5m GK, Fullkrug to Piroe, Rogers to... someone :P) which feels like too much. 3. I could do Andersen to KDH and just go with Neco BUT he\\'s not the absolute defcon monster Murillo is + they\\'ve been linked with Davies so potential rotation risk So can someone talk me out of Munoz (I\\'d get Richards instead) or Murillo?

There’s Community Shield action, numerous pre-season friendlies and 20 press conferences to come.\\n\\nThe upcoming Scout Squad nominations will also help shape the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nBut this early selection, at the very least, gives a bit of a flavour of the players and teams we’ll be considering.\\n\\nABOUT THE SCOUT PICKS ‘BUS TEAM’\\n\\nThis ‘bus team’ selection is essentially a first draft of what we will finalise a week on Thursday.\\n\\nThere are, as ever, certain restrictions for our squad:\\n\\nAn £83.0m budget for our starting XI\\n\\nAn overall squad limit of £100.0m\\n\\nNo more than three players per team\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 FIXTURES\\n\\nAbove: The Gameweek 1 fixtures sorted by difficulty on our Season Ticker.\\n\\nTHE LIKELY LADS\\n\\nThroughout the 2024/25 season, Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) was rarely missing from the Scout Picks, and it is highly likely that he will feature once more in Gameweek 1 of the upcoming campaign.\\n\\nThe Egyptian smashed the all-time FPL points record last time around and will host Bournemouth a week on Friday. The Cherries have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga (£4.5m), Dean Huijsen, and, of course, Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) to Liverpool this summer.\\n\\nSalah has a history of starting strong, too, having delivered a return on the opening day of every campaign since his arrival on Merseyside in 2017.\\n\\nCole Palmer (£10.5m) may feature in our Scout Picks selection, too.\\n\\nDespite a poor period in early 2025, the 23-year-old bounced back at the FIFA Club World Cup, contributing three goals and two assists in six matches.\\n\\nREAD MORE: 6 things we learned about Chelsea from the Club World Cup\\n\\nHe has also returned in each of his last three appearances against Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace. Indeed, Palmer created more chances against the Eagles than any other side in the 2024/25 season (10).\\n\\nNottingham Forest defensive representation, be it through Matz Sels (£5.0m), Nikola Milenkovic (£5.5m) or Murillo (£5.5m), also looks on the cards, with Brentford up first at the City Ground.\\n\\nKeith Andrews’s side have, of course, sold Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) this summer, with Yoane Wissa (£7.5m) expected to join him through the exit door. The pair accounted for 39 of Brentford’s 66 Premier League goals last term.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brentford – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nFor the time being, we have opted for Sels; however, it is worth noting that both Milenkovic and Murillo would have recorded defensive contribution (DC) points in the corresponding fixture last season.\\n\\nFurther forward, Chris Wood (£7.5m) carries obvious appeal.\\n\\nIN CONTENTION\\n\\nIt is possible that we will include additional Liverpool players in the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nFlorian Wirtz (£8.5m) and Cody Gakpo (£7.5m) are very much on our radar. We will also consider Virgil van Dijk (£6.0m), should he be fit for Sunday’s Community Shield match against Crystal Palace.\\n\\nAnd what about Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m)? The attack-minded right-back netted five goals and provided 12 assists for Bayer Leverkusen last season and could start against Bournemouth, given the doubts currently surrounding Conor Bradley’s (£5.0m) fitness.\\n\\nHowever, midfield anchor Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m) is suspended for this clash. That could be a setback for Liverpool’s clean sheet prospects.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL pre-season: Bradley injury boosts Frimpong + Salah pen miss\\n\\nAs you can see, we’ve targeted the three newly-promoted teams in our early draft.\\n\\nThis year’s newcomers, Leeds United, Burnley and Sunderland, will surely fare better than last year’s group. Still, there are legitimate concerns, given how big the step up to the Premier League is.\\n\\nIliman Ndiaye (£6.5m), Mohammed Kudus (£6.5m) and Jarrod Bowen (£8.0m) subsequently make the cut.\\n\\nThey are joined by James Tarkowski (£5.5m), Pedro Porro (£5.5m) and El Hadji Malick Diouf (£4.5m).\\n\\nNo player in any position would have gained as many DC points as Tarkowski last season, with 44. Now back after injury, he should be ready to start in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nPorro, meanwhile, has retained set-piece duties in pre-season and should fit well with Thomas Frank’s approach.\\n\\nAs for Diouf, he scored seven goals and provided four assists for Slavia Prague last season. After a wobbly showing against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series, he bounced back with a superb display against Bournemouth on Sunday, claiming the assist for Bowen’s second-half strike with a wicked delivery from the left. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£4.5m) could be a neat alternative in the West Ham United ranks.\\n\\nOther backline options in the Gameweek 1 mix include Robert Sanchez (£5.0m), Marc Cucurella (£6.0m), Josko Gvardiol (£6.0m), Rayan Ait-Nouri (£6.0m) and Maxim De Cuyper (£4.5m), who you can read more about here.\\n\\nRepresentation from Aston Villa and Newcastle United’s attack may be a goer. This fixture has produced plenty of goals in recent times, with 25 (!) across their previous six encounters:\\n\\nAbove image from 11 v 11\\n\\nMorgan Rogers (£7.0m) and Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), perhaps even Donyell Malen (£5.5m), are viable candidates. Notably, Watkins inspired Villa to a statement win over Newcastle in April.\\n\\nHowever, Emiliano Martinez (£5.0m) is suspended in Gameweek 1, so a Newcastle attacker isn’t out of the question. Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) is perhaps the most likely; he could be on penalties if Alexander Isak (£10.5m) isn’t involved.\\n\\nElsewhere, Kaoru Mitoma’s (£6.5m) 198.8 minutes per expected goal involvement (xGI) in 2024/25 was the best of any Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder. He’s probably the most secure attacker, too, with Danny Welbeck (£6.5m), Georginio Rutter (£6.0m) and Matt O’Riley (£5.5m) potentially competing for two starting spots.\\n\\nThat said, Albion have struggled to break down Fulham’s defensive shape in recent times, scoring just five goals in their last eight meetings.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brighton – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nManchester City are playing away at Wolverhampton Wanderers in Gameweek 1, so Erling Haaland (£14.0m) won’t be far from our thoughts, yet there might be better uses of the funds. There are cheaper alternatives in Pep Guardiola’s squad, like Omar Marmoush (£8.5m), Rayan Cherki (£6.5m) and Tijjani Reijnders (£5.5m). Hopefully, Saturday’s friendly against Palermo will offer insights into Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up.\\n\\nTHE LONGER SHOTS\\n\\nYou wouldn’t bet against Bukayo Saka (£10.0m), Kai Havertz (£7.5m) or Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) finding the net against Manchester United, but there are probably better picks elsewhere in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nThe same applies to Arsenal’s backline options, such as David Raya (£5.5m), William Saliba (£6.0m) and Gabriel Magalhaes (£6.0m), given that there were some promising glimpses of United’s new-look attack against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series on Sunday.\\n\\nHowever, Bruno Fernandes (£9.0m) and co remain outsiders for selection, given the strength of Arsenal’s defence in recent times.\\n\\nIf we do decide to switch up the forwards, Jean-Philippe Mateta (£7.5m), Joao Pedro (£7.5m) and Jorgen Strand Larsen (£6.5m) could become possible shouts, although it feels unlikely at this early stage.\\n\\nFinally, Harry Wilson (£5.5m) could be a cheeky differential against Brighton. He’s scored five goals and provided one assist in pre-season.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 EARLY SCOUT PICKS\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n320 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nEmiliano Sala\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nWhy dubravka?\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAC/DC AFC\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n5 days, 23 hours ago\\n\\nBurnley are in for him so you could get a playing £4m goalkeeper.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nJimmy B\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n5 days, 23 hours ago\\n\\n4m Burnley keeper though don\\'t forget.

DEF - Rotating the five defenders into 3 appearances I can go all the way to GW 12. Almost every week the 3 defenders are playing against weak teams Off the 36 total appearances, 12 X 3 defenders in team you get the following 34 of 36 games are against weak teams, the 2 exceptions Spurs v Villa and Spurs v Chelsea in weeks 8 and 10 (1 transfer could resolve this) 10 of the 36 against the 3 promoted teams FORWARDS Muniz has the No 9 shirt. Started first few games last season only for Raul to end up getting most of game time. Raul\\'s contract ended. They have brought him back on a 1 year deal. Muniz has this year and 1 more year on his contract. This is his year to be starter with Fulham. Bringing back a 35 yr old Raul for 1 year is just insurance and back up. Muniz 11 goals and 2 assists in just 1265 mins last season. Approx 1/3rd of a season. If Muniz doesn\\'t work I can always play a 3-5-2 Watkins swopped into Gyokores around GW7 when Villa\\'s run of good fixtures end and Arsenal\\'s start MIDFIELD Malen - excellent run of fixtures 5.5. Will score and assist probably more than Rogers. With Rashford and Asensio gone one of them will play RW, the other No 10. Bundesliga - 30 G and 16 A in 5800 minutes(approx 1.8 prem lge seasons) Eredevise - 40 G 15 A in just 4700 minutes( approx 1.5 FPL seasons) Ah but thats them leagues you say. So OK Champions League 6 G 1 A in 1500 minutes Europa League 9G 1A in 1100 minutes Premiere League 3G in 298 minutes You do not sign a player with that productivity in the January window to have him sit on the bench this season. Nailed starter. Reijnders 5.5m Screw pep Roulette. His is a nailed on No 8 even if Rodri is back. Box to box will score and assist 8 a piece and get his share of DC Points. Look how many DC points Bruno Fernandez at 9m gets playing No 8 Pep doesnt put new signings straight into the fire with all the choices he has. Reijnders started 3 of the 4 games in 90 degree plus heat and was\\'nt substituted like his team mates around him. He also started alongside Rodri. So for me its Rodri 6 Reijnders 8 How many minutes did the other new signing grabbing the headlines get. Rayan Cherki. 30 minutes in 4 games compared to Reijnders 270 Carvalho - is Mbuemo\\'s natural replacement. You dont like him there\\'s plenty of other 5m fish in the sea. Onana(AV), Baleba(Brighton), Adams(BMouth) etc Just like Malen if he gets off to a good start his price will rise and now you have equity to use elsewhere in the team The BONUS if you read this far. I geared the entire team towards week 13. That\\'s wildcard week. Thats where there\\'s a significant swing in the fixtures. Liverpool, Man City and Newcastle have a ton of games against the 3 promoted teams. GW 13 to GW 19 Liverpool versus, Sunderland, Leeds and Leeds Man City versus, Leeds, Leeds and Sunderland Newcastle versus, Burnley, Sunderland, Burnley. Hope you all found this of use.

Only suggestion, with all the conjecture around Watkins, I would go safer, maybe a Bowen or a 7.5 and use the extra cash just to tidy up a couple of positions. Can go 4.5 > Neco, Kinsky > 4.5 (opening an early BB) or leave it if Dubravka moves, Carvalho > Anderson etc. Effectively, that 1.0 or 1.5 just removes a couple of question marks. If Watkins stays, then its a moot point, however worth having a backup plan that may slightly reduce your ceiling, but would substantially raise your floor!\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nmartynteresa\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n5 days, 20 hours ago\\n\\nYeah I forgot to put in the bit about GW1 BB Kinsky - pending what Farke does in last games of preseason and cup. Optional flip to Dubravka Hoever - looks like he has the starting spot. Gomes and H Bueno fighting for LB spot last game but Wolves just signed a LB so now its wait and see if Hoever has the starting RB spot. If unsure - James Hill will start for Bournemouth when Zabarnyi leaves. Rodon at Leeds has 6 out of 1st 9 games versus week teams including a really bad Everton team 1st game. Watched their 3 games in the Prem Lge summer series they are in serious trouble Watkins. Villa signed Guessard but he will not trouble Watkins for the 1st 7. If he goes to Man Utd and has Cunha,Mbuemo and Bruno all providing assists for him he is still good. Also watching Ekitike. At 8.5 in a high scoring Liverpool team he would giveme a 1/2m flex for Kinksy or Hoever Neco is my pick of the DC plays but not convinced that Forest defence will hold up like it did last year. They conceded in every 1 of their last 9 games at end of season. The more expensive DC\\'s at Arsenal, Citeh, Pool have tough fixtures. May not get as many clean sheets as they usually do in the early games\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pretender\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n5 days, 20 hours ago\\n\\nCompletely valid and again well thought out. Watkins - I am concerned Man U start poorly. He\\'s just a wait and see for me at this stage at 9.0 not a risk I want to take until the transfer speculation is tidied up. Like the Ekitike shout but it seems he will face some competition be that from Isak or from Gakpo if we sign a LW and miss on Isak. Fair points on both above. Only reason I am keen on a Tree\\'s DEF is their preseason attacking form has been dreadful which makes me think that Nuno will go back to what worked for them to start the year, not playing as open as they were when they started to think they were a genuine top 4 team, and go back to trying to win 1-0 or take 0-0 results particularly away from home. Quite glad that they\\'re easier fixtures are at home and tougher fixtures are away (outside of Burnley) in their first 7 as I think this lines up nicely with them getting 2-3 CS in this time and their DC guys getting them in the tougher fixtures.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nIN SANE IN DE BRUYNE\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n5 days, 19 hours ago\\n\\nGood reading.

Makes it easier to know what’s real and what’s just rumor. They’ve already got a bunch of player statuses up (including some low-profile ones), and it’s updated daily.

Cheers for the assessment. Regarding Malen, I just saw earlier from a reputable Villa source on X that this new signing can play RW? Moreover, he said he no longer considers Malen an option.

In terms of defensive fixtures, it doesn\\'t get much better. They\\'ve proven they can do it, too. I agree with you\\'re thoughts on the expensive defenders not having good fixtures.

You know the usual, get him settled in, get his fitness level right, get him used to the tactics and whats expected of him.

Delap as competition. Without penalties scored just 5 goals last season. granted only 1900 mins.And only 6 the previous season in 2000 mins. 2.

however, it is important to highlight that Fernandes racked up 12 defensive contributions, which included nine recoveries.\\n\\nAbove: Bruno Fernandes’ touch heatmap v Fiorentina on Saturday, via Sofascore\\n\\nBenjamin Sesko (£7.5m), meanwhile, was presented to supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford, having sealed his move from RB Leipzig earlier in the day.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL new signings: What does new Man Utd forward Sesko offer?\\n\\nTwo of United’s other summer additions, namely Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) and Matheus Cunha (£8.0m), did feature.\\n\\nNeither player looks fully fit, but Mbeumo carried a threat with some wicked deliveries into the box and spent the second half up front.\\n\\nHe also created four chances for his teammates.\\n\\nAs for Cunha, he played off the left and almost netted the winner when he got on the end of Fernandes’ cross, but his effort was deflected over.\\n\\n“I think they [Cunha and Mbeumo] are maybe 50/60 per cent of what they can do. I think, like any other team, we are going to improve during the season, they are going to be so much better. In some moments I felt that we, because of the one-v-one in all the pitch, we struggle without a reference as a striker. We have a new player [Sesko] so we’ll see.” – Ruben Amorim\\n\\nWith only Andre Onana (£5.0m) and Joshua Zirkzee (£6.0m) absent for United – they trained on Monday – the starting XI hinted at Ruben Amorim’s line-up plans for the opener against Arsenal.\\n\\nManchester United XI: Bayindir; Yoro, Maguire (de Ligt 73), Heaven (Shaw 73); Amad, Casemiro (Mainoo 73), Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo (Dalot 73), Cunha; Mount (Ugarte 84)\\n\\nNOTTINGHAM FOREST 0-0 AL-QADSIAH\\n\\nNottingham Forest concluded their pre-season preparations with another lacklustre result, as they recorded their fifth goalless draw of the summer.\\n\\nIt means Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have scored just one goal in seven pre-season friendlies.\\n\\nAgainst Al-Qadsiah, summer signing Igor Jesus (£6.0m) partnered Chris Wood (£7.5m) up front and headed a couple of efforts wide.\\n\\nSubstitutes Jota Silva (£4.5m) and Taiwo Awoniyi (£5.5m) were later denied, but Forest once again failed to find the breakthrough.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.5m) should provide some creativity in the No 10 role. He missed out here due to a family matter.\\n\\nFive clean sheets in pre-season does at least offer some optimism ahead of Sunday’s opener against Brentford.\\n\\n“We have kept a solidity at the back and within the team. Everyone is defending well… that is a positive. Of course, we would like to score a lot more goals but it is pre-season. The real business starts next week. That is when we must find the back of the net.” – Ola Aina\\n\\nNeco Williams (£5.0m), meanwhile, linked well with Callum Hudson-Odoi (£6.0m) down Forest’s left flank and created a couple of chances for Jesus.\\n\\nNottingham Forest XI: Sels; Aina (Cunha 61), Murillo (Awoniyi 77), Milenkovic (Boly 61), Williams (Morato 77); Ndoye (Richards 77), Anderson (Sangare 61), Yates, Hudson-Odoi (Moreira 77); Wood (Stamenic 77), Jesus (Jota 61)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n540 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nBlzE_94\\n\\n10 Years\\n\\n2 hours, 31 mins ago\\n\\nWho would you captain here?

He would also have returned 30 defensive contribution points.\\n\\nPlay the fixtures\\n\\nTargeting the sides with kind schedules over the first four to six Gameweeks can help managers enjoy a strong start to the campaign.\\n\\nThere’s not as much need to look beyond that point as you have one free transfer each Gameweek to address any issues.\\n\\nChelsea\\'s opening six fixtures, for instance, are all ranked at three or below in the Fixture Difficulty Ratings (FDR), with one being the easiest possible match and five being the hardest.\\n\\nChelsea\\'s first six fixtures\\n\\nGameweek Opp. FDR* 1 Crystal Palace (H) 3 2 West Ham (A) 2 3 Fulham (H) 3 4 Brentford (A) 3 5 Man Utd (A) 3 6 Brighton (H) 3\\n\\n1=easiest possible fixture, 5=hardest possible fixture\\n\\nMarc Cucurella (£6.0m) is the standout option in Chelsea\\'s defence, having registered an impressive seven attacking returns last season.\\n\\nMoises Caicedo (£5.5m) could also deliver terrific value from the outset, too. Caicedo would have been one of the players to benefit the most from the addition of defensive contribution points last season. The midfielder would have registered an additional 42 points. As it was he registered 98 points for 12 clean sheets, one goal and four assists.\\n\\nDon’t take unnecessary risks\\n\\nWhen constructing your squad, look to limit the risk attached to each decision.\\n\\nIf a player is uncertain of featuring, for example, whether it be due to injury or a lack of pre-season action, simply leave them out and select someone more reliable.\\n\\nThis approach should be the same when picking your captain, who scores double points in each Gameweek.\\n\\nIn Gameweek 1 of 2025/26 Fantasy, picking a captain should be a relatively straightforward decision for most managers - Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) or Erling Haaland (£14.0m).\\n\\nSalah faces AFC Bournemouth having returned in every Gameweek 1 fixture he has played in, while Haaland will be up against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\\n\\nGranted, there are a number of strong alternatives such as Cole Palmer (£10.5m) and Brennan Johnson (£7.0m), who face Crystal Palace and Burnley respectively. But with millions likely to rely on Haaland and Salah, captaining anyone other than these two stars seems an unnecessary risk to start the season.\\n\\nGo cheap on the bench\\n\\nManagers should look to invest heavily in their starting XI and mainly use the bench for cut-price picks who you can turn to in emergencies.\\n\\nFor goalkeepers, a wise approach is to pick a £4.5m starter who offers plenty of save points in addition to clean-sheet potential, and who has a deputy costing only £4.0m.\\n\\nAlternatively, rotate a pair of £4.5m \\'keepers according to their fixtures and spend no more than £9.0m.\\n\\nIn defence this season, all three promoted clubs have regular starters who cost only £4.0m. Burnley\\'s Maxime Esteve, Leeds United\\'s Gabriel Gudmundsson and Sunderland\\'s Reinildo Mandava can prove very valuable squad players, freeing up funds for the bigger spends in attack.\\n\\nA smart tactic can be to rotate your squad, swapping players from your starting XI to your bench in each Gameweek depending on who has a better fixture.\\n\\nIn this case, limit that tactic to budget \\'keepers and defenders and simply plough the rest of your budget into your starting XI.\\n\\nAs midfielders and forwards are far more likely to deliver huge points returns in Fantasy, managers should focus the majority of their funds in attack.\\n\\nAlthough this season managers should also weigh up the benefit of a cheap midfielder with good potential for defensive contribution points.\\n\\nPrice points can help structure your squad\\n\\nAn opening squad should be structured in such a way that a manager is well-placed to react to any early trends without the need for multiple transfers.\\n\\nAfter all, managers are only given one free transfer in each Gameweek, and every additional transfer costs four points.\\n\\nUsing price points across each outfield position is a key tactic for planning ahead.\\n\\nFor example, some managers may decide to start with Ollie Watkins (£9.0m) alongside Haaland as their second forward in a 3-5-2 formation.\\n\\nWatkins\\' cost of £9.0m essentially allows a single-transfer move to almost any other forward who costs the same or less, apart from Alexander Isak (£10.5m) and Haaland.\\n\\nIn midfield, by starting with Cole Palmer (£10.5m), managers need just one transfer to bring in any other player in this position apart from Salah.\\n\\nFor defenders, the £6.0m price point covers a host of key names such as Josko Gvardiol, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Virgil van Dijk, Marc Cucurella, Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba.\\n\\nBy starting the season with Van Dijk for Liverpool\\'s fixtures, managers could easily move to Gabriel or Saliba if Arsenal are looking as strong defensively as they did last season, or ahead of their fixture swing in Gameweek 7, where the opposition they face may not be as tough. This depends on price rises/falls, of course.\\n\\nDo your research\\n\\nAfter assessing the player price list for FPL 2025/26 and the fixtures, follow pre-season form, set-piece takers, new signings and any changes of head coach and/or tactics.\\n\\nThe more knowledge you can soak up, the better chance there is of gaining an early advantage over your mini-league rivals.\\n\\nBe patient\\n\\nDon’t pencil in a transfer for Gameweek 2 in advance. If a key player gets injured or dropped in Gameweek 1, you may have far more important issues to deal with than the move you were planning to make.\\n\\nInstead, managers should construct their squads in a way that avoids the need to make a transfer in Gameweek 2.\\n\\nThis affords the luxury of heading into Gameweek 3 with two free transfers, which can open up a lot more options for squad changes.\\n\\nFPL managers are now able to bank up to five free transfers, of course. There is, therefore, an opportunity to make more widespread changes in September by holding fire on buying/selling over the opening Gameweeks.\\n\\nCrucially, by keeping faith in their early plans and waiting until Gameweek 3 or later before making any changes, managers also have extra Gameweeks\\' worth of valuable new information to base their decisions on.\\n\\nFPL basics\\n\\nPart 1: How to register Part 2: How to pick a squad Part 3: Managing your team Part 4: How to make transfers Part 5: How FPL points are scored Part 6: How to use chips Part 7: Mini-leagues and FPL Cups Part 8: How to use the statistics menu'),\n",

however, it is important to highlight that Fernandes racked up 12 defensive contributions, which included nine recoveries.\\n\\nAbove: Bruno Fernandes’ touch heatmap v Fiorentina on Saturday, via Sofascore\\n\\nBenjamin Sesko (£7.5m), meanwhile, was presented to supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford, having sealed his move from RB Leipzig earlier in the day.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL new signings: What does new Man Utd forward Sesko offer?\\n\\nTwo of United’s other summer additions, namely Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) and Matheus Cunha (£8.0m), did feature.\\n\\nNeither player looks fully fit, but Mbeumo carried a threat with some wicked deliveries into the box and spent the second half up front.\\n\\nHe also created four chances for his teammates.\\n\\nAs for Cunha, he played off the left and almost netted the winner when he got on the end of Fernandes’ cross, but his effort was deflected over.\\n\\n“I think they [Cunha and Mbeumo] are maybe 50/60 per cent of what they can do. I think, like any other team, we are going to improve during the season, they are going to be so much better. In some moments I felt that we, because of the one-v-one in all the pitch, we struggle without a reference as a striker. We have a new player [Sesko] so we’ll see.” – Ruben Amorim\\n\\nWith only Andre Onana (£5.0m) and Joshua Zirkzee (£6.0m) absent for United – they trained on Monday – the starting XI hinted at Ruben Amorim’s line-up plans for the opener against Arsenal.\\n\\nManchester United XI: Bayindir; Yoro, Maguire (de Ligt 73), Heaven (Shaw 73); Amad, Casemiro (Mainoo 73), Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo (Dalot 73), Cunha; Mount (Ugarte 84)\\n\\nNOTTINGHAM FOREST 0-0 AL-QADSIAH\\n\\nNottingham Forest concluded their pre-season preparations with another lacklustre result, as they recorded their fifth goalless draw of the summer.\\n\\nIt means Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have scored just one goal in seven pre-season friendlies.\\n\\nAgainst Al-Qadsiah, summer signing Igor Jesus (£6.0m) partnered Chris Wood (£7.5m) up front and headed a couple of efforts wide.\\n\\nSubstitutes Jota Silva (£4.5m) and Taiwo Awoniyi (£5.5m) were later denied, but Forest once again failed to find the breakthrough.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.5m) should provide some creativity in the No 10 role. He missed out here due to a family matter.\\n\\nFive clean sheets in pre-season does at least offer some optimism ahead of Sunday’s opener against Brentford.\\n\\n“We have kept a solidity at the back and within the team. Everyone is defending well… that is a positive. Of course, we would like to score a lot more goals but it is pre-season. The real business starts next week. That is when we must find the back of the net.” – Ola Aina\\n\\nNeco Williams (£5.0m), meanwhile, linked well with Callum Hudson-Odoi (£6.0m) down Forest’s left flank and created a couple of chances for Jesus.\\n\\nNottingham Forest XI: Sels; Aina (Cunha 61), Murillo (Awoniyi 77), Milenkovic (Boly 61), Williams (Morato 77); Ndoye (Richards 77), Anderson (Sangare 61), Yates, Hudson-Odoi (Moreira 77); Wood (Stamenic 77), Jesus (Jota 61)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n540 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nBlzE_94\\n\\n10 Years\\n\\n2 hours, 25 mins ago\\n\\nWho would you captain here?

There’s Community Shield action, numerous pre-season friendlies and 20 press conferences to come.\\n\\nThe upcoming Scout Squad nominations will also help shape the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nBut this early selection, at the very least, gives a bit of a flavour of the players and teams we’ll be considering.\\n\\nABOUT THE SCOUT PICKS ‘BUS TEAM’\\n\\nThis ‘bus team’ selection is essentially a first draft of what we will finalise a week on Thursday.\\n\\nThere are, as ever, certain restrictions for our squad:\\n\\nAn £83.0m budget for our starting XI\\n\\nAn overall squad limit of £100.0m\\n\\nNo more than three players per team\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 FIXTURES\\n\\nAbove: The Gameweek 1 fixtures sorted by difficulty on our Season Ticker.\\n\\nTHE LIKELY LADS\\n\\nThroughout the 2024/25 season, Mohamed Salah (£14.5m) was rarely missing from the Scout Picks, and it is highly likely that he will feature once more in Gameweek 1 of the upcoming campaign.\\n\\nThe Egyptian smashed the all-time FPL points record last time around and will host Bournemouth a week on Friday. The Cherries have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga (£4.5m), Dean Huijsen, and, of course, Milos Kerkez (£6.0m) to Liverpool this summer.\\n\\nSalah has a history of starting strong, too, having delivered a return on the opening day of every campaign since his arrival on Merseyside in 2017.\\n\\nCole Palmer (£10.5m) may feature in our Scout Picks selection, too.\\n\\nDespite a poor period in early 2025, the 23-year-old bounced back at the FIFA Club World Cup, contributing three goals and two assists in six matches.\\n\\nREAD MORE: 6 things we learned about Chelsea from the Club World Cup\\n\\nHe has also returned in each of his last three appearances against Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace. Indeed, Palmer created more chances against the Eagles than any other side in the 2024/25 season (10).\\n\\nNottingham Forest defensive representation, be it through Matz Sels (£5.0m), Nikola Milenkovic (£5.5m) or Murillo (£5.5m), also looks on the cards, with Brentford up first at the City Ground.\\n\\nKeith Andrews’s side have, of course, sold Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) this summer, with Yoane Wissa (£7.5m) expected to join him through the exit door. The pair accounted for 39 of Brentford’s 66 Premier League goals last term.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brentford – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nFor the time being, we have opted for Sels; however, it is worth noting that both Milenkovic and Murillo would have recorded defensive contribution (DC) points in the corresponding fixture last season.\\n\\nFurther forward, Chris Wood (£7.5m) carries obvious appeal.\\n\\nIN CONTENTION\\n\\nIt is possible that we will include additional Liverpool players in the final Scout Picks.\\n\\nFlorian Wirtz (£8.5m) and Cody Gakpo (£7.5m) are very much on our radar. We will also consider Virgil van Dijk (£6.0m), should he be fit for Sunday’s Community Shield match against Crystal Palace.\\n\\nAnd what about Jeremie Frimpong (£6.0m)? The attack-minded right-back netted five goals and provided 12 assists for Bayer Leverkusen last season and could start against Bournemouth, given the doubts currently surrounding Conor Bradley’s (£5.0m) fitness.\\n\\nHowever, midfield anchor Ryan Gravenberch (£5.5m) is suspended for this clash. That could be a setback for Liverpool’s clean sheet prospects.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL pre-season: Bradley injury boosts Frimpong + Salah pen miss\\n\\nAs you can see, we’ve targeted the three newly-promoted teams in our early draft.\\n\\nThis year’s newcomers, Leeds United, Burnley and Sunderland, will surely fare better than last year’s group. Still, there are legitimate concerns, given how big the step up to the Premier League is.\\n\\nIliman Ndiaye (£6.5m), Mohammed Kudus (£6.5m) and Jarrod Bowen (£8.0m) subsequently make the cut.\\n\\nThey are joined by James Tarkowski (£5.5m), Pedro Porro (£5.5m) and El Hadji Malick Diouf (£4.5m).\\n\\nNo player in any position would have gained as many DC points as Tarkowski last season, with 44. Now back after injury, he should be ready to start in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nPorro, meanwhile, has retained set-piece duties in pre-season and should fit well with Thomas Frank’s approach.\\n\\nAs for Diouf, he scored seven goals and provided four assists for Slavia Prague last season. After a wobbly showing against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series, he bounced back with a superb display against Bournemouth on Sunday, claiming the assist for Bowen’s second-half strike with a wicked delivery from the left. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£4.5m) could be a neat alternative in the West Ham United ranks.\\n\\nOther backline options in the Gameweek 1 mix include Robert Sanchez (£5.0m), Marc Cucurella (£6.0m), Josko Gvardiol (£6.0m), Rayan Ait-Nouri (£6.0m) and Maxim De Cuyper (£4.5m), who you can read more about here.\\n\\nRepresentation from Aston Villa and Newcastle United’s attack may be a goer. This fixture has produced plenty of goals in recent times, with 25 (!) across their previous six encounters:\\n\\nAbove image from 11 v 11\\n\\nMorgan Rogers (£7.0m) and Ollie Watkins (£9.0m), perhaps even Donyell Malen (£5.5m), are viable candidates. Notably, Watkins inspired Villa to a statement win over Newcastle in April.\\n\\nHowever, Emiliano Martinez (£5.0m) is suspended in Gameweek 1, so a Newcastle attacker isn’t out of the question. Anthony Gordon (£7.5m) is perhaps the most likely; he could be on penalties if Alexander Isak (£10.5m) isn’t involved.\\n\\nElsewhere, Kaoru Mitoma’s (£6.5m) 198.8 minutes per expected goal involvement (xGI) in 2024/25 was the best of any Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder. He’s probably the most secure attacker, too, with Danny Welbeck (£6.5m), Georginio Rutter (£6.0m) and Matt O’Riley (£5.5m) potentially competing for two starting spots.\\n\\nThat said, Albion have struggled to break down Fulham’s defensive shape in recent times, scoring just five goals in their last eight meetings.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL 2025/26 team previews: Brighton – Best players, DC magnets + more\\n\\nManchester City are playing away at Wolverhampton Wanderers in Gameweek 1, so Erling Haaland (£14.0m) won’t be far from our thoughts, yet there might be better uses of the funds. There are cheaper alternatives in Pep Guardiola’s squad, like Omar Marmoush (£8.5m), Rayan Cherki (£6.5m) and Tijjani Reijnders (£5.5m). Hopefully, Saturday’s friendly against Palermo will offer insights into Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up.\\n\\nTHE LONGER SHOTS\\n\\nYou wouldn’t bet against Bukayo Saka (£10.0m), Kai Havertz (£7.5m) or Viktor Gyokeres (£9.0m) finding the net against Manchester United, but there are probably better picks elsewhere in Gameweek 1.\\n\\nThe same applies to Arsenal’s backline options, such as David Raya (£5.5m), William Saliba (£6.0m) and Gabriel Magalhaes (£6.0m), given that there were some promising glimpses of United’s new-look attack against Everton in the Premier League Summer Series on Sunday.\\n\\nHowever, Bruno Fernandes (£9.0m) and co remain outsiders for selection, given the strength of Arsenal’s defence in recent times.\\n\\nIf we do decide to switch up the forwards, Jean-Philippe Mateta (£7.5m), Joao Pedro (£7.5m) and Jorgen Strand Larsen (£6.5m) could become possible shouts, although it feels unlikely at this early stage.\\n\\nFinally, Harry Wilson (£5.5m) could be a cheeky differential against Brighton. He’s scored five goals and provided one assist in pre-season.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 EARLY SCOUT PICKS\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n320 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nEmiliano Sala\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nWhy dubravka?\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nAC/DC AFC\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\nBurnley are in for him so you could get a playing £4m goalkeeper.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nJimmy B\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n11 Years\\n\\n6 days, 1 hour ago\\n\\n4m Burnley keeper though don\\'t forget.

DEF - Rotating the five defenders into 3 appearances I can go all the way to GW 12. Almost every week the 3 defenders are playing against weak teams Off the 36 total appearances, 12 X 3 defenders in team you get the following 34 of 36 games are against weak teams, the 2 exceptions Spurs v Villa and Spurs v Chelsea in weeks 8 and 10 (1 transfer could resolve this) 10 of the 36 against the 3 promoted teams FORWARDS Muniz has the No 9 shirt. Started first few games last season only for Raul to end up getting most of game time. Raul\\'s contract ended. They have brought him back on a 1 year deal. Muniz has this year and 1 more year on his contract. This is his year to be starter with Fulham. Bringing back a 35 yr old Raul for 1 year is just insurance and back up. Muniz 11 goals and 2 assists in just 1265 mins last season. Approx 1/3rd of a season. If Muniz doesn\\'t work I can always play a 3-5-2 Watkins swopped into Gyokores around GW7 when Villa\\'s run of good fixtures end and Arsenal\\'s start MIDFIELD Malen - excellent run of fixtures 5.5. Will score and assist probably more than Rogers. With Rashford and Asensio gone one of them will play RW, the other No 10. Bundesliga - 30 G and 16 A in 5800 minutes(approx 1.8 prem lge seasons) Eredevise - 40 G 15 A in just 4700 minutes( approx 1.5 FPL seasons) Ah but thats them leagues you say. So OK Champions League 6 G 1 A in 1500 minutes Europa League 9G 1A in 1100 minutes Premiere League 3G in 298 minutes You do not sign a player with that productivity in the January window to have him sit on the bench this season. Nailed starter. Reijnders 5.5m Screw pep Roulette. His is a nailed on No 8 even if Rodri is back. Box to box will score and assist 8 a piece and get his share of DC Points. Look how many DC points Bruno Fernandez at 9m gets playing No 8 Pep doesnt put new signings straight into the fire with all the choices he has. Reijnders started 3 of the 4 games in 90 degree plus heat and was\\'nt substituted like his team mates around him. He also started alongside Rodri. So for me its Rodri 6 Reijnders 8 How many minutes did the other new signing grabbing the headlines get. Rayan Cherki. 30 minutes in 4 games compared to Reijnders 270 Carvalho - is Mbuemo\\'s natural replacement. You dont like him there\\'s plenty of other 5m fish in the sea. Onana(AV), Baleba(Brighton), Adams(BMouth) etc Just like Malen if he gets off to a good start his price will rise and now you have equity to use elsewhere in the team The BONUS if you read this far. I geared the entire team towards week 13. That\\'s wildcard week. Thats where there\\'s a significant swing in the fixtures. Liverpool, Man City and Newcastle have a ton of games against the 3 promoted teams. GW 13 to GW 19 Liverpool versus, Sunderland, Leeds and Leeds Man City versus, Leeds, Leeds and Sunderland Newcastle versus, Burnley, Sunderland, Burnley. Hope you all found this of use.

Only suggestion, with all the conjecture around Watkins, I would go safer, maybe a Bowen or a 7.5 and use the extra cash just to tidy up a couple of positions. Can go 4.5 > Neco, Kinsky > 4.5 (opening an early BB) or leave it if Dubravka moves, Carvalho > Anderson etc. Effectively, that 1.0 or 1.5 just removes a couple of question marks. If Watkins stays, then its a moot point, however worth having a backup plan that may slightly reduce your ceiling, but would substantially raise your floor!\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nmartynteresa\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n5 days, 21 hours ago\\n\\nYeah I forgot to put in the bit about GW1 BB Kinsky - pending what Farke does in last games of preseason and cup. Optional flip to Dubravka Hoever - looks like he has the starting spot. Gomes and H Bueno fighting for LB spot last game but Wolves just signed a LB so now its wait and see if Hoever has the starting RB spot. If unsure - James Hill will start for Bournemouth when Zabarnyi leaves. Rodon at Leeds has 6 out of 1st 9 games versus week teams including a really bad Everton team 1st game. Watched their 3 games in the Prem Lge summer series they are in serious trouble Watkins. Villa signed Guessard but he will not trouble Watkins for the 1st 7. If he goes to Man Utd and has Cunha,Mbuemo and Bruno all providing assists for him he is still good. Also watching Ekitike. At 8.5 in a high scoring Liverpool team he would giveme a 1/2m flex for Kinksy or Hoever Neco is my pick of the DC plays but not convinced that Forest defence will hold up like it did last year. They conceded in every 1 of their last 9 games at end of season. The more expensive DC\\'s at Arsenal, Citeh, Pool have tough fixtures. May not get as many clean sheets as they usually do in the early games\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pretender\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n9 Years\\n\\n5 days, 21 hours ago\\n\\nCompletely valid and again well thought out. Watkins - I am concerned Man U start poorly. He\\'s just a wait and see for me at this stage at 9.0 not a risk I want to take until the transfer speculation is tidied up. Like the Ekitike shout but it seems he will face some competition be that from Isak or from Gakpo if we sign a LW and miss on Isak. Fair points on both above. Only reason I am keen on a Tree\\'s DEF is their preseason attacking form has been dreadful which makes me think that Nuno will go back to what worked for them to start the year, not playing as open as they were when they started to think they were a genuine top 4 team, and go back to trying to win 1-0 or take 0-0 results particularly away from home. Quite glad that they\\'re easier fixtures are at home and tougher fixtures are away (outside of Burnley) in their first 7 as I think this lines up nicely with them getting 2-3 CS in this time and their DC guys getting them in the tougher fixtures.\\n\\nOpen Controls\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nLogin To Reply\\n\\n\\n\\nIN SANE IN DE BRUYNE\\n\\n8 Years\\n\\n5 days, 21 hours ago\\n\\nGood reading.

Makes it easier to know what’s real and what’s just rumor. They’ve already got a bunch of player statuses up (including some low-profile ones), and it’s updated daily.

Cheers for the assessment. Regarding Malen, I just saw earlier from a reputable Villa source on X that this new signing can play RW? Moreover, he said he no longer considers Malen an option.

In terms of defensive fixtures, it doesn\\'t get much better. They\\'ve proven they can do it, too. I agree with you\\'re thoughts on the expensive defenders not having good fixtures.

More assists. Twice as many chips. Bonus point tweaks. Extra transfers in December.\\n\\nHere’s all you need to know.\\n\\n1. Defensive contributions\\n\\nIt’s a big boost for defensive midfielders and centre-halves!\\n\\nOutfield players will now be rewarded for their defensive contributions with FPL points if they meet the following thresholds:\\n\\nREAD MORE:\\n\\nFPL 2025/26: Huge rule change as defensive contributions come in\\n\\nWhere you can find all of last season’s FPL defensive contribution points\\n\\nWhat is Rodri’s defensive contribution points potential in FPL?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a block?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a clearance?\\n\\nHow do Opta define an interception?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a tackle?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a recovery?\\n\\n2. Double the chips – but Assistant Manager gets the boot\\n\\nRIP the Assistant Manager chip!\\n\\nInstead, we’re getting two of every chip in 2025/26.\\n\\nNo new ones, just the old favourites of the last 10 years: Wildcard, Free Hit, Bench Boost and Triple Captain.\\n\\nSimilar to the use of the first Wildcard in recent seasons, we must play this first set of chips before the Gameweek 19 deadline passes.\\n\\nWe cannot carry them over into the second half of 2025/26.\\n\\nThe second set of chips then becomes available after the Gameweek 19 deadline has passed.\\n\\nOur initial thoughts can be found here.\\n\\n3. More assists to be awarded\\n\\nThere’ll be more assists in 2025/26, with the rules tweaked to be less strict.\\n\\nRules around handballs, defensive touches and, crucially, ‘intended destination/target’ have been relaxed.\\n\\nIf these new 2025/26 rules had been in operation last season, there would have been 41 extra Fantasy assists awarded!\\n\\nYou can read the full details here.\\n\\n4. Extra transfers for AFCON\\n\\nFantasy managers will be given extra free transfers in Gameweek 16 to help cope with the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) exodus in December.\\n\\nFPL bosses’ total number of free transfers will be topped up to the maximum possible number of five in Gameweek 16.\\n\\nYou can find more info here.\\n\\n5. Bonus Points System (BPS) changes\\n\\nThere have been some tweaks to the Bonus Points System (BPS) ahead of the new campaign.\\n\\nIt’s not a radical overhaul: the best-performing players (in terms of BPS scores) still receive one, two and three bonus points in every fixture.\\n\\nBut some of the numbers that go towards deciding this have been changed ahead of 2025/26.\\n\\nSave-making goalkeepers and goalline-clearing outfielders should be better off; those scoring penalties less so.\\n\\nThe full breakdown is here.\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

It isn't about who to pick this week or even next, a good manager looks at blocks of fixtures and targets players with good medium-term fixture runs. Doing so avoids knee-jerking on moves, especially for players that only have one good fixture and then a not-so-great run. Have a plan and stick to it as much as possible.\\n\\nHOLLY: Team form and upcoming fixture ease are two vitally important metrics to consider when making transfers. Keep a close eye on both when planning transfers, in order to pick up key players before their hot streak begins and steal a march on your rivals.\\n\\nBalance premium picks in your week one team\\n\\nHOLLY: It's important to strike the right balance of premium players, particularly at the start of the season when form is more unpredictable.\\n\\nFor greater transfer flexibility, try to pick a premium player in each position in your gameweek one team and then make a captaincy matrix for upcoming weeks to hone in on your key transfer targets.\\n\\nWho to pick, who to avoid - your team's FPL assets ranked\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n18 hours ago\\n\\nCan Salah do it again? Avoid Mbeumo & Cunha? Five key FPL questions\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n3 days ago\\n\\nWhat's changed in FPL for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n4 August\\n\\nDon't be stubborn when you've made a mistake\\n\\nHEISENBERG: You have to acknowledge when you've made an error by either bringing a player in you shouldn't have, or by ignoring a player in hot form that needs to come in.\\n\\nIt happens to us all - the key is to rectify these situations as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAvoid hits and early transfers\\n\\nGIANNI: It's better to roll transfers and go weeks without one if you can. Stay patient, use your bench if you need to and accumulate transfers. With several free transfers you can make significant changes to your team structure and make moves for even the most expensive assets without taking hits.\\n\\nHOLLY: I try to avoid early transfers wherever possible - information is always key and so I won't make my moves until a Friday afternoon. The exception to this rule is when there are no midweek European fixtures (like before gameweek two) or where you may be priced out of a move you have exact funds for.\\n\\nTrust your gut\\n\\nMAX: Last season I changed the way I play. I didn't have as much time as before to be online and consume FPL content. Everything I did last season was purely gut instinct - I didn't look at any statistics!\\n\\nI was changing my team 30 minutes before the deadline, going for players I really liked and trusting my gut. Even though I'm a maths teacher I stayed away from statistics as you can get bogged down in them and over analyse things.\\n\\nThe pod is BACK! (sort of)\\n\\nPay attention to minutes, set-pieces and penalty takers\\n\\nPRAS: Sometimes, counter-intuitively, FPL is about picking the reliable players over flair players.\\n\\nAn example I used to use was even though Riyad Mahrez looked amazing on the eye, a player like Bruno Fernandes was always a far superior FPL pick, simply because he was nailed on to play 90 minutes, take free-kicks and penalties.\\n\\nThese points add up and make these picks more fixture-proof since a free-kick goal or penalty is not as dependant on the difficulty of the opponent.\\n\\nWhen stuck between two players, always pick the guy taking penalties or set-pieces.\\n\\nWatch as much Premier League football as you can\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Watch full matches where possible and extended highlights of all the games. Watching more football allows you to spot things you may not notice from stats alone, while it also allows you to interpret data easier as you'll have the required context.\\n\\nMAX: I watched a lot of games last season, so I was seeing players I enjoyed watching and going for them - using the good old eye test.\\n\\nAvoid panic buys and rage sells - back your decisions\\n\\nPRAS: FPL is a game of patience, but football is a very unpredictable sport. This is a recipe for a lot of regret.\\n\\nYou pick Bukayo Saka as your captain and he misses a penalty. This is an example of good decision, bad outcome.\\n\\nManagers must understand there is an element of luck in the game but making good decisions over the long-term generally leads to good outcomes. Trust the process.\\n\\nDon't understimate the importance of xG\\n\\nGIANNI: Some fans are not keen on expected goals (xG) as a metric, but it is important in FPL.\\n\\nIf an attacker is clocking a high xG but not converting that into goals, they're either a bad finisher or more likely, they're close to catching a big haul really soon.\\n\\nMake sure you know the new rules and adjust\\n\\nGIANNI: Goals and assists will always be king but the new defensive contribution points will change how we build our FPL teams moving forward, especially when shopping for budget defenders and midfielders.\\n\\nThe first few weeks could be a learning curve so pay close attention and be ready to react.\\n\\nWhat are FPL's new rules for 25-26?\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n4 August\\n\\nSave money in defence\\n\\nMAX: I never spend a lot of money on defensive options. This year I'm going for two £4.5m defenders and two £4.0m\\n\\nIf they pick up clean sheets then great, and I'm banking on them making up the difference to more expensive picks with the new defensive contribution points.\\n\\nI've never spent much on defence - with the exception of an FPL star such as Trent Alexander-Arnold - and once I've picked my defence I tend to set and forget.\\n\\nAnd finally - stop caring about other people's teams\\n\\nHEISENBERG: Everyone wants to beat their mini-league rivals and finish with as high a rank as possible, but you can get stuck if you pay too much attention to other people's teams.\\n\\nDon't try to be the same as them. Don't try to be different to them.\\n\\nSimply focus on what you can control - your own team - to maximise your points. Your overall rank and mini-leagues will take care of themselves.\\n\\nRelated topics\\n\\nPremier League\\n\\nFootball\"),\n",

He was reportedly still in Hawaii on July 31!\\n\\nWe might be looking at a little while (potentially after the September international break?) in terms of starting contention, then, if he requires time to build up his match fitness.\\n\\nGuiu was followed into the club by Arthur Masuaku at the weekend, and Le Bris discussed the pair with reporters.\\n\\n“We are still in the process to improve the squad and progressively new signings like these two will help the squad, even if they started later. So, we’ll have to be patient with them, to build their foundations for the season.” – Regis Le Bris on Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku, to in-house club media\\n\\n“We’ll see. Every day, we will make an assessment of their level and see how far we can push them through the training sessions. Lift the intensity, the contact. If they react well, they can then join the squad. If they don’t react well, we wait one day, two days, and assess again. So we will see for next week.” – Regis Le Bris on whether Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku will be fit for Gameweek 1, via the Northern Echo\\n\\nANOTHER MISSED SUNDERLAND PENALTY!\\n\\nAfter Sunderland failed to score with four of their five penalties last season, a new taker was given the chance against Augsburg – and missed.\\n\\nEliezer Mayenda (£5.5m) took this latest effort, skying it over the bar.\\n\\nThat’s a blow for the budget striker’s FPL appeal, who has the chance to further his claim up front while Guiu is getting up to speed. Another positional rival, Wilson Isidor (£5.5m), is just back from injury,\\n\\nWill he get another chance from 12 yards or will someone like Habib Diarra (£5.5m), who took penalties for Strasbourg last season, get an opportunity? We shall see.\\n\\nMayenda has not had the best pre-season in front of goal in general. On Saturday again, it was everything but the goal. Lots of good movement but wasteful finishing, including two clear-cut chances aside from the spot-kick.\\n\\nHe’s a real talent, the Spain under-21 international, but the finishing still needs finessing. He’s underachieved on the xG front in his embryonic career so far, indeed.\\n\\nGAMEWEEK 1 LINE-UP CLUES – NO LE FEE?\\n\\nUnlike the Machiavellian Eddie Howe up the road, Le Bris wasn’t messing about with his two teamsheets.\\n\\nThe team against Augsburg looked full strength, with the line-up against Vallecano anything but.\\n\\nBased on that evidence, Enzo Le Fee (£5.0m) looks set to be a starting XI casualty in Gameweek 1.\\n\\n“We’ll have two or three players like Enzo, really close to the starting XI but at the same time, we have to make a choice because we can only play with 11 players.” – Regis Le Bris\\n\\nTwo £4.0m defenders, Jenson Seelt (£4.0m) and Reinildo Mandava (£4.0m), are in pole position to start against West Ham.\\n\\nWhile Seelt is very likely a stopgap, Reinildo has an excellent chance to establish himself in the side longer term. He was lively at left-back, wriggling his way through to almost get a shooting chance not long before he won Sunderland’s penalty with another dash.\\n\\nRobin Roefs (£4.5m) meanwhile looks set to start between the posts, having kept a clean sheet and saved a penalty against Augsburg.\\n\\nGranit Xhaka (£5.0m) impressed again in midfield and hit the bar with one free-kick, while Diarra popped up in some eye-catchingly advanced positions and scored with one of his efforts. Simon Adingra (£5.5m) supplied the assist.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Augsburg: Roefs; Hume, Ballard, Seelt (J.Jones 83), Reinildo; Xhaka, Sadiki (Tuterovi 86), Diarra; Talbi, Adingra, Mayenda.\\n\\nSunderland XI against Vallecano: Patterson (Nna Noukeu 68); Huggins, Lavery (J. Jones 68), Triantis, H. Jones; Neil, Le Fée, Browne; Rigg (Aleksic 68), Roberts, Isidor (Tuterov 68).\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.

I really REALLY want Munoz and Murillo, but I can\\'t find a way to have them both + VVD without really compromising somewhere else on my team. For example... 1. I\\'d have to do Fullkrug to Guiu, which feels like a dead spot on the bench + I plan on starting Big Nick for most of the first 5 GWs 2. I\\'d have to do Andersen to KDH and shave 0.5 elsewhere (Sanchez to 4.5m GK, Fullkrug to Piroe, Rogers to... someone :P) which feels like too much. 3. I could do Andersen to KDH and just go with Neco BUT he\\'s not the absolute defcon monster Murillo is + they\\'ve been linked with Davies so potential rotation risk So can someone talk me out of Munoz (I\\'d get Richards instead) or Murillo?

It sets the foundations for you going into the season. Last season I didn’t have that. I didn’t play in any pre-season games so I was trying to play catch-up. For me, it’s massive to play these games, feel good, get your confidence up and go into the season all guns blazing.” – Ollie Watkins\\n\\nEmiliano Buendia (£5.5m) has certainly taken his chance to impress, too.\\n\\nHe was on the scoresheet against Villarreal, firing a shot into the bottom corner. He also claimed the assist for Watkins’ opener. It’d still be a huge surprise if he started against Newcastle United on Saturday, mind, even if Morgan Rogers (£7.0m) is ruled out through injury.\\n\\nAs for the Marseille takeaways, John McGinn (£5.5m) scored Villa’s only goal in a feisty 3-1 defeat, having been picked out by Jacob Ramsey (£5.5m). Ramsey was a constant threat down the left and was unfortunate not to register a second assist.\\n\\nElsewhere, new arrival Evann Guessand (£6.5m) was used from the bench in both friendly matches, playing around 45 minutes of football in total.\\n\\nThe Ivorian was deployed on the left in Spain, mostly adopting a narrow role that enabled Ian Maatsen (£4.5m) to overlap. He’s a versatile asset, however, with plenty of time spent on the right and through the middle at his previous club, Nice.\\n\\nMALEN UNCERTAINTY\\n\\nEmery mixed up his players across these two friendlies, with no indication of a ‘best XI’ in either game.\\n\\nIt’s not ideal for Donyell Malen (£5.5m), who has been one of Villa’s standout performers in pre-season.\\n\\nIn the latest friendlies, he’s been used up front, sharing minutes with Watkins rather than playing on the right, where a starting spot is much more likely to open up for him.\\n\\nDoes this mean Emery views Malen as cover for Watkins instead of a regular starter on the wing? Recent evidence certainly supports this notion.\\n\\nElsewhere, Marco Bizot (£4.5m) started in goal against Marseille, and with Emiliano Martinez (£5.0m) suspended, he should get the nod again against Newcastle.\\n\\nOn the fitness front, there was no Morgan Rogers across either match as expected. If we see him in training later this week, however, don’t bet against him starting on Saturday.\\n\\nAston Villa XI v Marseille: Bizot; Cash (Konsa 81), Bogarde, Mings, Digne (Moreno 81); Hemmings (Kamara 81), Onana; Iling Jr (Burrowes 81), McGinn (Tielemans 81), Ramsey (Buendia 68); Malen (Guessand 68)\\n\\nAston Villa XI v Villarreal: Martinez (Bizot 82); Rowe (Bogarde 82), Konsa, Pau, Maatsen (Moreno 82); Kamara (McGinn 71), Tielemans; Bailey (Hemmings 82), Buendia (Patterson 85), Jimoh-Aloba (Guessand 67); Watkins (Dobbin 82)\\n\\nPALERMO 0-3 MANCHESTER CITY\\n\\nGoals: Haaland, Reijnders x2\\n\\nAssists: Lewis, Savinho, Mukasa\\n\\nREIJNDERS SCORES TWICE\\n\\nHas Tijjani Reijnders (£5.5m) just played his way into Pep Guardiola’s Gameweek 1 starting XI?\\n\\nThe Dutchman undoubtedly made an impression in Sicily, netting two second-half goals against Serie B outfit Palermo. Both strikes showcased his trademark late runs into the box.\\n\\nHe nearly grabbed a hat-trick, too, as he rounded the Palermo ‘keeper only to stumble at the crucial moment.\\n\\nStill, with four shots in just 45 minutes of football, this was an impressive run-out.\\n\\n“Yeah, we knew that he is a special player arriving into the box. He loves to do that. People in Italy know him perfectly. He scored two goals and he made a fantastic performance like the rest of his teammates. He can play as a holding midfielder but he loves to arrive to the box to help our strikers like Erling [Haaland] and Omar [Marmoush] and anyone who plays there. We are really pleased.” – Pep Guardiola on Tijjani Reijnders\\n\\nAbove: Tijjani Reijnders’ touch heatmap v Palermo on Saturday, via Sofascore\\n\\nErling Haaland (£14.0m) opened the scoring in Italy.\\n\\nPep Guardiola used a different XI in each half, with only the Norwegian featuring in both.\\n\\nCHERKI BRIGHT\\n\\nAnother new arrival, Rayan Cherki (£6.5m), also caught the eye.\\n\\nWith Phil Foden (£8.0m) recovering from a knock back in Manchester (Josko Gvardiol (£6.0m) also wasn’t fit enough to travel), the Frenchman was deployed in a No 10 role behind Haaland.\\n\\nHe had a shot that was narrowly deflected wide and was arguably City’s best player, with so much of their play going through him.\\n\\nGiven that Omar Marmoush (£8.5m) wasn’t at his free-flowing best here, Cherki may be given an opportunity to start at Molineux on Saturday.\\n\\nRayan Ait-Nouri (£6.0m) also featured in Italy, leaving a positive impression on Guardiola; however, James Trafford (£5.0m) had a much tougher time with some sloppy moments in possession.\\n\\n“The three signings we have done before the World Cup were really good. Cherki, Ait Nouri and Reijnders. We haven’t played many games. We’ve trained well but now we’ll go back to Manchester, try to make a good week and prepare the games. I am happy [with the squad] since the USA and our World Cup. Our vibes there were really good.” – Pep Guardiola\\n\\nElsewhere, with Rodri (£6.5m) set to miss the start of the season due to slow recovery from a groin issue, Nico Gonzalez (£6.0m) and Ilkay Gundogan (£6.5m) shared the No 6 role.\\n\\nManchester City first-half XI: Trafford; Lewis, Khusanov, Stones, Ait-Nouri; Gonzalez, O’Reilly; Bobb, Cherki, Marmoush; Haaland\\n\\nManchester City second-half XI: Ederson; Nunes, Dias, Ake, Akanji; Gundogan, Reijnders; Savinho, Bernardo, Doku; Haaland (Mukasa 70)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n285 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nPatrickK123\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n4 Years\\n\\n10 hours, 7 mins ago\\n\\nWould it be crazy/kneejerk to suggest that 2 x 5.5 Defenders (for me it\\'d be Murillo and Tark/Munoz) might be better than VVD + 5.0 Defender?

He needs to play and for sure, he is going to help. He is a fantastic player.” – Enzo Maresca on Estevao\\n\\nAbove: Estevao’s shot map v Leverkusen on Friday, via Sofascore\\n\\nPalmer, who regularly drifted into dangerous positions, went off at half-time, with Estevao taking over the No 10 role.\\n\\nSubstitute Joao Pedro (£7.5m) rounded it off late on, firing home in injury time.\\n\\nElsewhere, Jamie Gittens (£6.5m) was thrown on in the second half, but Christopher Nkunku (£6.0m) and Nicolas Jackson (£6.5m) were both left out of the matchday squad amid transfer speculation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Levi Colwill (£5.0m) is likely to miss the entirety of the 2025/26 season after sustaining a long-term injury.\\n\\nTrevoh Chalobah (£5.0m) took his place at Stamford Bridge on Friday, but it sounds like the club are already in the market for a new centre-back.\\n\\n“It is a priority for me, yes. Levi is a fantastic player; what we achieved last season was because of him. He played all games and I love him. We are going to miss him. We are trying to find different solutions. We will see [signing a defender].” – Enzo Maresca\\n\\nChelsea return to action on Sunday, as they host AC Milan, before turning their attention to Sunday’s Premier League opener against Crystal Palace.\\n\\nOn Friday’s evidence, they look more than ready.\\n\\nChelsea XI: Jorgensen; Gusto (James 64), Acheampong (Anselmino 76), Chalobah (Tosin 45), Cucurella (Hato 45); Caicedo (Essugo 45), Santos (Rak-Sakyi 76); Estevao (Antwi 67), Palmer (Neto 45), George (64); Delap (J Pedro 64)\\n\\nBRENTFORD 2-2 BORUSSIA MONCHENGLADBACH\\n\\nGoals: Carvalho, Damsgaard\\n\\nAssists: Collins\\n\\nCaoimhin Kelleher (£4.5m) was a surprise absentee for Brentford on Friday, having picked up a knock in training.\\n\\nKevin Schade (£7.0m) also missed out for the second pre-season friendly in a row.\\n\\nBoth players will be monitored over the coming days.\\n\\nAs for the on-pitch action, Fabio Carvalho (£5.0m) and Mikkel Damsgaard (£6.0m) both got on the scoresheet for Keith Andrews’ side.\\n\\nCarvalho, who has impressed in pre-season and attempted four shots here, volleyed home after a set-piece was headed across goal by Nathan Collins (£5.0m).\\n\\nA couple of minutes later, a loose pass was intercepted by Damsgaard, who made no mistake.\\n\\nNotably, Damsgaard’s set-piece deliveries were a real threat throughout at the Gtech Community Stadium.\\n\\nElsewhere, Keane Lewis-Potter (£5.0m) lined up out-of-position as a left winger. He put in some decent crosses and came close to scoring, only for his effort to deflect wide.\\n\\nIgor Thiago (£6.0m), however, looked isolated for large periods and registered just one shot which was blocked by the opposition.\\n\\nBrentford play again tomorrow against Gladbach at the training ground, with some of those who didn’t play on Friday expected to feature.\\n\\nBrentford XI: Valdimarrson; Kayode (Hickey 82), van den Berg (Ajer 62), Collins, Henry (Roerslev 82); Jensen (Milambo 75), Yarmoliuk; Carvalho, Damsgaard, Lewis-Potter; Thiago (Henderson 75)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n385 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nBagpuss\\n\\nFantasy Football Scout Member\\n\\n16 Years\\n\\n2 days, 14 hours ago\\n\\nHi - does anyone know if there have been any defence rotation articles yet please?

however, it is important to highlight that Fernandes racked up 12 defensive contributions, which included nine recoveries.\\n\\nAbove: Bruno Fernandes’ touch heatmap v Fiorentina on Saturday, via Sofascore\\n\\nBenjamin Sesko (£7.5m), meanwhile, was presented to supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford, having sealed his move from RB Leipzig earlier in the day.\\n\\nREAD MORE: FPL new signings: What does new Man Utd forward Sesko offer?\\n\\nTwo of United’s other summer additions, namely Bryan Mbeumo (£8.0m) and Matheus Cunha (£8.0m), did feature.\\n\\nNeither player looks fully fit, but Mbeumo carried a threat with some wicked deliveries into the box and spent the second half up front.\\n\\nHe also created four chances for his teammates.\\n\\nAs for Cunha, he played off the left and almost netted the winner when he got on the end of Fernandes’ cross, but his effort was deflected over.\\n\\n“I think they [Cunha and Mbeumo] are maybe 50/60 per cent of what they can do. I think, like any other team, we are going to improve during the season, they are going to be so much better. In some moments I felt that we, because of the one-v-one in all the pitch, we struggle without a reference as a striker. We have a new player [Sesko] so we’ll see.” – Ruben Amorim\\n\\nWith only Andre Onana (£5.0m) and Joshua Zirkzee (£6.0m) absent for United – they trained on Monday – the starting XI hinted at Ruben Amorim’s line-up plans for the opener against Arsenal.\\n\\nManchester United XI: Bayindir; Yoro, Maguire (de Ligt 73), Heaven (Shaw 73); Amad, Casemiro (Mainoo 73), Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo (Dalot 73), Cunha; Mount (Ugarte 84)\\n\\nNOTTINGHAM FOREST 0-0 AL-QADSIAH\\n\\nNottingham Forest concluded their pre-season preparations with another lacklustre result, as they recorded their fifth goalless draw of the summer.\\n\\nIt means Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have scored just one goal in seven pre-season friendlies.\\n\\nAgainst Al-Qadsiah, summer signing Igor Jesus (£6.0m) partnered Chris Wood (£7.5m) up front and headed a couple of efforts wide.\\n\\nSubstitutes Jota Silva (£4.5m) and Taiwo Awoniyi (£5.5m) were later denied, but Forest once again failed to find the breakthrough.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.5m) should provide some creativity in the No 10 role. He missed out here due to a family matter.\\n\\nFive clean sheets in pre-season does at least offer some optimism ahead of Sunday’s opener against Brentford.\\n\\n“We have kept a solidity at the back and within the team. Everyone is defending well… that is a positive. Of course, we would like to score a lot more goals but it is pre-season. The real business starts next week. That is when we must find the back of the net.” – Ola Aina\\n\\nNeco Williams (£5.0m), meanwhile, linked well with Callum Hudson-Odoi (£6.0m) down Forest’s left flank and created a couple of chances for Jesus.\\n\\nNottingham Forest XI: Sels; Aina (Cunha 61), Murillo (Awoniyi 77), Milenkovic (Boly 61), Williams (Morato 77); Ndoye (Richards 77), Anderson (Sangare 61), Yates, Hudson-Odoi (Moreira 77); Wood (Stamenic 77), Jesus (Jota 61)\\n\\nPosted by villans82 Follow them on Twitter\\n\\n540 Comments Login to Post a Comment\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\nFirst\\n\\n…\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n…\\n\\nLast\\n\\n» Next\\n\\n\\n\\nBlzE_94\\n\\n10 Years\\n\\n2 hours, 25 mins ago\\n\\nWho would you captain here?

Defensive contributions\\n\\nIt’s a big boost for defensive midfielders and centre-halves!\\n\\nOutfield players will now be rewarded for their defensive contributions with FPL points if they meet the following thresholds:\\n\\nREAD MORE:\\n\\nFPL 2025/26: Huge rule change as defensive contributions come in\\n\\nWhere you can find all of last season’s FPL defensive contribution points\\n\\nWhat is Rodri’s defensive contribution points potential in FPL?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a block?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a clearance?\\n\\nHow do Opta define an interception?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a tackle?\\n\\nHow do Opta define a recovery?\\n\\n2. Double the chips – but Assistant Manager gets the boot\\n\\nRIP the Assistant Manager chip!\\n\\nInstead, we’re getting two of every chip in 2025/26.\\n\\nNo new ones, just the old favourites of the last 10 years: Wildcard, Free Hit, Bench Boost and Triple Captain.\\n\\nSimilar to the use of the first Wildcard in recent seasons, we must play this first set of chips before the Gameweek 19 deadline passes.\\n\\nWe cannot carry them over into the second half of 2025/26.\\n\\nThe second set of chips then becomes available after the Gameweek 19 deadline has passed.\\n\\nOur initial thoughts can be found here.\\n\\n3. More assists to be awarded\\n\\nThere’ll be more assists in 2025/26, with the rules tweaked to be less strict.\\n\\nRules around handballs, defensive touches and, crucially, ‘intended destination/target’ have been relaxed.\\n\\nIf these new 2025/26 rules had been in operation last season, there would have been 41 extra Fantasy assists awarded!\\n\\nYou can read the full details here.\\n\\n4. Extra transfers for AFCON\\n\\nFantasy managers will be given extra free transfers in Gameweek 16 to help cope with the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) exodus in December.\\n\\nFPL bosses’ total number of free transfers will be topped up to the maximum possible number of five in Gameweek 16.\\n\\nYou can find more info here.\\n\\n5. Bonus Points System (BPS) changes\\n\\nThere have been some tweaks to the Bonus Points System (BPS) ahead of the new campaign.\\n\\nIt’s not a radical overhaul: the best-performing players (in terms of BPS scores) still receive one, two and three bonus points in every fixture.\\n\\nBut some of the numbers that go towards deciding this have been changed ahead of 2025/26.\\n\\nSave-making goalkeepers and goalline-clearing outfielders should be better off; those scoring penalties less so.\\n\\nThe full breakdown is here.\\n\\nSkonto Rigga Neale is the Editor of Fantasy Football Scout.
