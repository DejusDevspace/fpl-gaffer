      "Mbeumo and Cunha united without a No 9\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the anticipation ahead of the new season at Old Trafford stems from the big-money signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, in a 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw against Everton the pair started a match together and impressed, despite neither putting their name on the scoresheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Mbeumo lined up on the right, it was interesting to see Cunha given an opportunity to play as something of a false 9. In truth, the front three, which also featured Bruno Fernandes, were incredibly fluid positionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both new signings caught the eye with their desire to drive at the Everton defence, while Mbeumo frequently showed his dangerous movement into channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the pair will be deployed in future depends on any further attacking signings United might make, but they showed just how important they will be.\n",

      "On a day that was supposed to be all about Son’s farewell, Tottenham Hotspur’s plans for the season were rocked by what Thomas Frank described as a “bad” injury for James Maddison right at the end of their 1-1 draw with Newcastle United in South Korea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The England international was carried off on a stretcher after going down unchallenged late in the game. Frank subsequently confirmed it was the same knee that had caused Maddison problems when unable to play in the UEFA Europa League final win last season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think sometimes in life and football things can be both beautiful and brutal – that’s what we got today,” said Frank. “It looks like with Madders a bad injury, and then on the other side unbelievable scenes for Son from his team-mates and the respect from the Newcastle players.”\n",
