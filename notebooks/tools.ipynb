He is a key player that we need to keep and continue to develop. Future captain!\\n\\n   Tom: I'm very glad we kept a talent like Jarrad - he is one of my favourite players in this Everton team and brings confidence to the defence. He drives the team on and on, and I think he should be captain when Seamus Coleman leaves. [...] Andy: Calvert-Lewin has done a job for the last few seasons but if we're going to escape the relegation battles, we need to find a striker who will deliver more and push us up the table. Shake hands and wish him the best.\\n\\n    Chris: It's a shame we couldn't hold on to him for one more season as a squad player with a generous contract until we could get a new striker. [...] Ben: Strand Larsen had a decent start to his Wolves career but he really kicked into gear after Vitor Pereira arrived. Excellent news he is staying - looks a reliable goalscorer and his physical presence helps dictate the shape of the team.\\n\\n   Allan: Tall, strong and clinical in front of goal. If he gets the service, I'm sure he will add many more goals to his tally. Very pleased to see him become a permanent signing.\\n\\n   Reuben: Yeah, viva Larsen!\",\n",
